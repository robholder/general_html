<div id="Running Shell Commands In Vim"><h2 id="Running Shell Commands In Vim" class="header"><a href="#Running Shell Commands In Vim">Running Shell Commands In Vim</a></h2></div>

<p>
In Vim, the <code>!</code> command is used to pass text (like a file or a selection) to an external shell command and replace it with the output.
</p>

<div id="External (Shell) Commands"><h1 id="External (Shell) Commands" class="header"><a href="#External (Shell) Commands">External (Shell) Commands</a></h1></div>

<p>
Run external (shell) commands, prefix with the bang (<code>!</code>):
</p>

<pre vim>
:!ls
</pre>

<div id="Rerunning The Last [[External]] Command"><h1 id="Rerunning The Last [[External]] Command" class="header"><a href="#Rerunning The Last [[External]] Command">Rerunning The Last <a href="External.html">External</a> Command</a></h1></div>

<p>
Repeat the last used external command:
</p>

<pre vim>
:!!
</pre>

<div id="Rerunning The Last [[External]] Command-Tips for Using Shell Commands in Vim"><h3 id="Tips for Using Shell Commands in Vim" class="header"><a href="#Rerunning The Last [[External]] Command-Tips for Using Shell Commands in Vim">Tips for Using Shell Commands in Vim</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Entire File: Use <code>:%!&lt;command&gt;</code> to apply a shell command to the entire file.

<li>
Visual Selections: Use visual mode to highlight text (<code>v</code> or <code>V</code>):

<ul>
<li>
then run <code>:!&lt;command&gt;</code> to apply the command to the selection.

</ul>
<li>
Current Line: Apply a command to the current line with <code>:.!&lt;command&gt;</code>.

</ul>

<p>
These commands open up a world of possibilities for processing and manipulating text inside Vim.
</p>

<div id="Finding Duplicate Lines in a Buffer"><h1 id="Finding Duplicate Lines in a Buffer" class="header"><a href="#Finding Duplicate Lines in a Buffer">Finding Duplicate Lines in a Buffer</a></h1></div>

<p>
This is destructive, so backup or duplicate the buffer/file before running the following.
</p>

<p>
You can use Vim's <code>sort</code> to sort the lines, then call on the shell too <code>uniq</code> to delete all except an instance of duplicated lines:
</p>

<pre vim>
" In Vim
:sort

" then
:% !uniq -d
</pre>

<div id="Finding Duplicate Lines in a Buffer-Key Features of uniq:"><h4 id="Key Features of uniq:" class="header"><a href="#Finding Duplicate Lines in a Buffer-Key Features of uniq:">Key Features of uniq:</a></h4></div>

<p>
Default Behavior:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
By default, <code>uniq</code> removes consecutive duplicate lines from the input, leaving only unique lines in the output.

<li>
Options for Custom Behavior:

<li>
<code>-c</code>: Prefixes each output line with the count of occurrences.

<li>
<code>-d</code>: Displays only duplicate lines, skipping unique lines.

<li>
<code>-u</code>: Displays only unique lines, skipping duplicates.

<li>
<code>-i</code>: Performs case-insensitive comparisons.

<li>
<code>--repeated</code>: An alternative to -d, showing only repeated lines.

<li>
<code>--unique</code>: An alternative to -u.

</ul>

<div id="Formatting CSV Files into tables"><h1 id="Formatting CSV Files into tables" class="header"><a href="#Formatting CSV Files into tables">Formatting CSV Files into tables</a></h1></div>

<p>
Here's how <code>!column -ts,</code> works when used in Vim:
</p>

<div id="Formatting CSV Files into tables-Breaking it Down:"><h4 id="Breaking it Down:" class="header"><a href="#Formatting CSV Files into tables-Breaking it Down:">Breaking it Down:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>column</code> --&gt; This is a Unix command that arranges text into a table-like format.

<li>
<code>-t</code> --&gt; Enables table formatting, aligning columns neatly with spaces.

<li>
<code>-s,</code> --&gt; Specifies the delimiter, in this case, a comma <code>,</code>. This means it processes Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files, treating the comma as the boundary between columns.

</ul>


<p>
In Vim: The <code>!</code> operator pipes the content of Vim (or a selection) to the shell, executes the command, and replaces the text in Vim with the formatted output.
</p>

<div id="Formatting CSV Files into tables-How to Use It in Vim:"><h3 id="How to Use It in Vim:" class="header"><a href="#Formatting CSV Files into tables-How to Use It in Vim:">How to Use It in Vim:</a></h3></div>

<p>
Here are two ways you might implement this in Vim:
</p>

<div id="Formatting CSV Files into tables-How to Use It in Vim:-Formatting the Entire File:"><h4 id="Formatting the Entire File:" class="header"><a href="#Formatting CSV Files into tables-How to Use It in Vim:-Formatting the Entire File:">Formatting the Entire File:</a></h4></div>

<p>
If your entire file is a CSV and you'd like to format it as a table:
</p>
<pre vim>
:%!column -ts,
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
<code>%</code> --&gt; Refers to the entire file in Vim.

<li>
<code>!column -ts,</code> --&gt; Runs the column command on the file and replaces the text with its output.

</ul>

<div id="Formatting CSV Files into tables-How to Use It in Vim:-Formatting a Specific Selection"><h4 id="Formatting a Specific Selection" class="header"><a href="#Formatting CSV Files into tables-How to Use It in Vim:-Formatting a Specific Selection">Formatting a Specific Selection</a></h4></div>

<p>
If you'd like to format just a block of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Switch to visual mode by pressing <code>v</code> (or <code>V</code> for line-wise selection).

<li>
Highlight the desired block of text.

<li>
Type the following and press Enter:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:!column -ts,
</pre>

<p>
This sends the selected text to the shell, runs <code>column -ts,</code>, and replaces the selection with the tabled output.
</p>

<div id="Formatting CSV Files into tables-Example Input and Output in Vim:"><h3 id="Example Input and Output in Vim:" class="header"><a href="#Formatting CSV Files into tables-Example Input and Output in Vim:">Example Input and Output in Vim:</a></h3></div>

<p>
If your file contains:
</p>
<pre>
Name,Age,Location
Alice,30,New York
Bob,25,Los Angeles
</pre>

<p>
After running <code>!column -ts,</code> you'll see this in Vim:
</p>
<pre>
Name     Age  Location
Alice    30   New York
Bob      25   Los Angeles
</pre>


<div id="Shell Command Notes"><h1 id="Shell Command Notes" class="header"><a href="#Shell Command Notes">Shell Command Notes</a></h1></div>

<p>
Vim provides several ways to pass the contents of your buffer directly to shell commands, process them, and even update the buffer with the results. Here's how you can do it:
</p>

<div id="Shell Command Notes-Using ! to Run Shell Commands"><h3 id="Using ! to Run Shell Commands" class="header"><a href="#Shell Command Notes-Using ! to Run Shell Commands">Using ! to Run Shell Commands</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
You can run the current buffer through a shell command and replace it with the output. For example:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:%!sort
</pre>

<p>
This sorts all the lines in your buffer, replacing the original content with the sorted result.
</p>

<div id="Shell Command Notes-Using ! to Run Shell Commands-Explanation:"><h4 id="Explanation:" class="header"><a href="#Shell Command Notes-Using ! to Run Shell Commands-Explanation:">Explanation:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>:%</code> means "apply the command to the entire buffer."

<li>
<code>!</code> executes the shell command (sort, in this case) on the buffer content.

</ul>

<div id="Shell Command Notes-Specifying Line Ranges"><h3 id="Specifying Line Ranges" class="header"><a href="#Shell Command Notes-Specifying Line Ranges">Specifying Line Ranges</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
You can apply shell commands to specific lines instead of the entire buffer. For example:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:10,20!awk '{print $1}'
</pre>

<p>
This sends lines 10 through 20 to awk, processes them, and replaces those lines with the result.
</p>

<div id="Shell Command Notes-Working with Visual Selection"><h3 id="Working with Visual Selection" class="header"><a href="#Shell Command Notes-Working with Visual Selection">Working with Visual Selection</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
If you visually select some text (using <code>v</code> or <code>V</code>), you can pipe only the selection to a shell command:

</ul>
  
<pre>
!sort
</pre>

<p>
This processes the selection using sort and replaces it with the output.
</p>

<div id="Shell Command Notes-Filtering Content"><h3 id="Filtering Content" class="header"><a href="#Shell Command Notes-Filtering Content">Filtering Content</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
You can use a shell command as a filter to process parts of the buffer. For example, to remove blank lines:

</ul>
  
<pre>
:%!grep .
</pre>

<div id="Shell Command Notes-Saving Output Temporarily"><h3 id="Saving Output Temporarily" class="header"><a href="#Shell Command Notes-Saving Output Temporarily">Saving Output Temporarily</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
If you'd like to keep your buffer untouched but still send its content to a shell command, you can redirect output without modifying the buffer:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:w !grep "ERROR"
</pre>
<p>
This runs grep on the buffer's content, displays the results in the terminal, and leaves your buffer unchanged.
</p>

<div id="Shell Command Notes-Integrating Shell Output"><h3 id="Integrating Shell Output" class="header"><a href="#Shell Command Notes-Integrating Shell Output">Integrating Shell Output</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
If you want to insert the result of a shell command into your buffer, you can use <code>:r</code> to read the output:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:r !ls
</pre>

<p>
This inserts the output of the ls command into your buffer at the current cursor position.
</p>

<div id="Shell Command Notes-Tips for Efficiency"><h3 id="Tips for Efficiency" class="header"><a href="#Shell Command Notes-Tips for Efficiency">Tips for Efficiency</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Undo-Friendly: Any changes made with shell commands can be reverted using u, so you don't have to worry about experimenting.

<li>
Combine Commands: You can chain shell commands for more complex processing (e.g., <code>:%!awk '{print $NF}' | sort</code>).

</ul>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh"><h1 id="The Command: :%w !sh" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh">The Command: :%w !sh</a></h1></div>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means"><h2 id="What It Means" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means">What It Means</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>:%</code> Specifies a range in Vim—in this case, every line in the current buffer.

<li>
<code>w</code> (Write) Writes the contents of the specified range:

<ul>
<li>
Here, it writes the entire buffer to the STDIN (NOT TO DISK).

<li>
<code>w</code> acts as a pipe to the STDIN (Standard Input), and not a literal write to disk.

</ul>
<li>
<code>!sh</code> The exclamation mark <code>!</code> tells Vim to take that written output and pipe it as standard input (STDIN) to an external command. In this example, the external command is <code>sh</code>, which is the Unix shell. In other words, your buffer’s contents are fed directly to the shell as if you typed them into it.

</ul>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-How It Works"><h3 id="How It Works" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-How It Works">How It Works</a></h3></div>

<p>
When you type <code>:%w !sh</code> in Vim:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Vim selects all lines in your current file (because of <code>:%</code>).

<li>
It then writes—or sends—those lines through a pipe to the standard input of the <code>sh</code> command.

<li>
The <code>sh</code> program receives that text on its STDIN and interprets it as a shell script.

<li>
The output of that shell script (if any) is shown to you, but the buffer itself remains unchanged.

</ul>
 
<p>
<span id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-How It Works-Note:"></span><strong id="Note:">Note:</strong>
This is different from the <code>:%!cmd</code> form.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>:%!cmd</code> would replace the entire buffer with the output generated by <code>cmd</code>.

<li>
With <code>:%w !cmd</code>, Vim only sends the buffer contents to <code>cmd</code> and then displays its output (often temporarily), while keeping your file intact.

</ul>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Background &amp; Uses"><h3 id="Background &amp; Uses" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Background &amp; Uses">Background &amp; Uses</a></h3></div>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Background &amp; Uses-Background"><h4 id="Background" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Background &amp; Uses-Background">Background</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Background &amp; Uses-Background-Filtering Mechanism in Vim:"></span><strong id="Filtering Mechanism in Vim:">Filtering Mechanism in Vim:</strong> Vim supports the idea of filters, where you take a block of text, process it through an external program, and then do something with the result (display it, replace text, etc.).

<li>
<span id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Background &amp; Uses-Background-Standard Input (STDIN):"></span><strong id="Standard Input (STDIN):">Standard Input (STDIN):</strong> In UNIX-like systems, programs can read from STDIN. Using <code>:w !sh</code>, Vim leverages this by writing the buffer’s text directly to the shell’s STDIN. This is a powerful way to let your text serve as instructions or data for an external process.

</ul>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses"><h3 id="Practical Uses" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses">Practical Uses</a></h3></div>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses-Testing Shell Scripts Quickly:"><h4 id="Testing Shell Scripts Quickly:" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses-Testing Shell Scripts Quickly:">Testing Shell Scripts Quickly:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
If you're writing a shell script, you can edit it in Vim (without saving it to a file) and then use <code>:%w !sh</code> to pipe its contents directly into sh for execution. This makes it easy to iterate and test snippets of code.

</ul>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses-Code Evaluation :"><h4 id="Code Evaluation :" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses-Code Evaluation :">Code Evaluation :</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>:%w !python</code>

<li>
You can apply this idea to other interpreters as well. For example, if you have Python code in your buffer, you could use <code>:%w !python</code> to run the code.

</ul>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses-Data Processing or Filtering Without Changing the Buffer:"><h4 id="Data Processing or Filtering Without Changing the Buffer:" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses-Data Processing or Filtering Without Changing the Buffer:">Data Processing or Filtering Without Changing the Buffer:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Sometimes, you might want to see what happens when a block of text is processed by an external program (for example, a formatter or a converter) without altering your current copy of the file.

</ul>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses-Learning &amp; Debugging:"><h4 id="Learning &amp; Debugging:" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Practical Uses-Learning &amp; Debugging:">Learning &amp; Debugging:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
For newcomers, it’s an excellent way of understanding how external commands interact with Vim. You see firsthand how your file’s content can be used as input to a command and how output is returned.

</ul>

<div id="The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Example Scenario"><h3 id="Example Scenario" class="header"><a href="#The Command: :%w !sh-What It Means-Example Scenario">Example Scenario</a></h3></div>

<p>
Imagine you have the following shell script in your Vim buffer:
</p>

<pre sh>
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello, world!"
date
</pre>

<p>
By executing <code>:%w !sh</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Vim sends the entire script to the shell.

<li>
The shell runs it, printing:

</ul>
  
<pre sh>
Hello, world!
&lt;current date and time&gt;
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Vim shows this output (often in a temporary window or message area), and your original text remains unchanged.

</ul>

<p>
This approach is part of Vim's power in integrating with the shell environment—allowing you to seamlessly combine editing and command execution. If you’re experimenting with scripts or need to process documents without leaving Vim, this method is invaluable.
