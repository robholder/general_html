<p>
In the standard mathematical and physics context from which these formulas are derived, and in many 3D graphics applications:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The y-axis is synonymous with "up and down" ‚¨ÜÔ∏è.

<li>
The z-axis is synonymous with "toward and away from the viewer" (or depth) ‚ÜîÔ∏è.

</ul>
<p>
This is often referred to as a right-handed coordinate system. If you point the thumb of your right hand along the positive x-axis, your index finger along the positive y-axis, and your middle finger along the positive z-axis, they form a perpendicular "L" shape, with the z-axis pointing straight out.
</p>

<p>
The formulas below are used to find a point on a sphere of radius r using two angles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>œï</code> (phi), the inclination or polar angle from the positive z-axis,

<li>
<code>Œ∏</code> (theta), the azimuthal angle from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane.

</ul>
<div id="Point on a Unit Sphere Given the Polar Angle and the Azimuth Angle-Coordinate System-The standard formulas are:"><h3 id="The standard formulas are:" class="header"><a href="#Point on a Unit Sphere Given the Polar Angle and the Azimuth Angle-Coordinate System-The standard formulas are:">The standard formulas are:</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>x = r * sin(œï) * cos(Œ∏)</code>

<li>
<code>y = r * sin(œï) * sin(Œ∏)</code>

<li>
<code>z = r * cos(œï)</code>

</ul>
<p>
For a unit sphere, where <code>radius r=1</code>. The formulas simplify to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>x = sin(œï) * cos(Œ∏)</code>

<li>
<code>y = sin(œï) * sin(Œ∏)</code>

<li>
<code>z = cos(œï)</code>

</ul>

<p>
This system is often used in computer graphics and game development.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>x = cos(rotation.y) * cos(rotation.x)</code>

<li>
<code>y = sin(rotation.x)</code>

<li>
<code>z = sin(rotation.y) * cos(rotation.x)</code>

</ul>

<p>
The formula provided above is a variation of the standard spherical coordinates. It uses two angles: one for horizontal rotation (rotation.y) and another for vertical rotation (rotation.x).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="The Common Orientation for Computer Graphics-How it Works-Vertical Rotation (rotation.x)"></span><strong id="Vertical Rotation (rotation.x)">Vertical Rotation (rotation.x)</strong>: This angle, which we can call œï, controls the "up and down" movement.

<ul>
<li>
The y-coordinate is determined by sin(œï). When œï is 0, the point is on the equator (y=0). When œï is 90¬∫, it's at the north pole (y=1).

<li>
The term cos(œï) acts as a scaling factor for the x and z coordinates. When you're at the equator (œï=0), cos(œï)=1, so the x and z values are at their full range. As you move toward the poles (œï‚Üí¬±90¬∫), cos(œï) ‚Üí 0, which correctly shrinks the x and z values to zero, bringing the point to the pole.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="The Common Orientation for Computer Graphics-How it Works-Horizontal Rotation (rotation.y)"></span><strong id="Horizontal Rotation (rotation.y)">Horizontal Rotation (rotation.y)</strong>: This angle, which we can call Œ∏, controls the "side-to-side" movement around the y-axis.

<ul>
<li>
The x-coordinate is determined by cos(Œ∏) and the scaling factor from the vertical rotation.

<li>
The z-coordinate is determined by sin(Œ∏) and the same scaling factor.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
This setup is consistent and works because it's a direct geometric projection. It's as if you first rotate a point around the x-axis and then rotate the resulting point around the y-axis.

This is why the terms appear in different places but still produce a valid result on the sphere. It's a matter of coordinate system and angle naming convention

<div id="How the Correct Formulas Work üåê"><h1 id="How the Correct Formulas Work üåê" class="header"><a href="#How the Correct Formulas Work üåê">How the Correct Formulas Work üåê</a></h1></div>

<p>
The derivation of these formulas relies on a two-step application of basic trigonometry.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a point P on the unit sphere.
</p>

<div id="How the Correct Formulas Work üåê-Finding the z-coordinate:"><h4 id="Finding the z-coordinate:" class="header"><a href="#How the Correct Formulas Work üåê-Finding the z-coordinate:">Finding the z-coordinate:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
The polar angle <code>œï</code> is the angle between the positive z-axis and the line segment from the origin to point P.

<li>
This creates a right-angled triangle where the hypotenuse is the radius of the sphere (which is 1 for a unit sphere). The adjacent side to the angle <code>œï</code> is the vertical distance from the origin, which is the z-coordinate.

<li>
Using the definition of cosine <code>(cos(œï)= hypotenuse/adjacent)</code> we get:

<ul>
<li>
<code>cos(œï)= z/1 = z = cos(œï)</code>

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="How the Correct Formulas Work üåê-Finding the x and y-coordinates:"><h4 id="Finding the x and y-coordinates:" class="header"><a href="#How the Correct Formulas Work üåê-Finding the x and y-coordinates:">Finding the x and y-coordinates:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
The side opposite to the angle <code>œï</code> is the radius of a circle created by projecting the point P onto the xy-plane. Let's call this projected <code>radius r-xy</code>

<li>
Using the definition of sine <code>(sin(œï)= hypotenuse/opposite)</code>, we find the length of this projected radius:

</ul>
<p>
<code>sin(œï)=  rxy/1 = rxy =sin(œï)</code>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Now, we have a new right-angled triangle in the xy-plane. The hypotenuse of this triangle is rxy. The <code>azimuthal</code> angle <code>Œ∏</code> is the angle between the positive x-axis and this projected radius <code>rxy</code>

<li>
Using sine and cosine on this new triangle:

<li>
<code>x = rxy cos(Œ∏) = sin(œï)cos(Œ∏)</code>

<li>
<code>y = rxy sin(Œ∏) = sin(œï)sin(Œ∏)</code>

</ul>
<p>
By combining these two steps, we can find any point on a unit sphere using two angles.
</p>

<div id="Graphic Representation-How the Graphic Representation Works"><h2 id="How the Graphic Representation Works" class="header"><a href="#Graphic Representation-How the Graphic Representation Works">How the Graphic Representation Works</a></h2></div>

<p>
The graphic representation of this concept, whether static or interactive, typically highlights two key right-angled triangles to demonstrate the formulas.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The Vertical Triangle üìê: This triangle is in a vertical plane that slices the sphere. Its vertices are:

<ul>
<li>
The origin (0,0,0).

<li>
The point P on the surface of the sphere.

<li>
The point on the z-axis directly below or above P.

<li>
The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of the sphere, which is 1 for a unit sphere.

<li>
The adjacent side to the polar angle œï is the z-coordinate.

<li>
The opposite side to the angle œï is the projected radius onto the xy-plane.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
This triangle is what gives us the formulas for the z-coordinate (z=cos(œï)) and the projected radius (rxy=sin(œï)).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The Horizontal Triangle üî∫: This triangle is in the xy-plane. Its vertices are:

<li>
The origin (0,0,0).

<li>
The point where the projected radius intersects the x-axis.

<li>
The point where the projected radius intersects the y-axis.  The hypotenuse of this triangle is the projected radius from the vertical triangle (rxy).

<li>
The adjacent side to the azimuthal angle Œ∏ is the x-coordinate.

<li>
The opposite side to the angle Œ∏ is the y-coordinate.

</ul>
<p>
Using this triangle, we get the formulas for the x and y coordinates: x=rxy cos(Œ∏) and y=r xy sin(Œ∏). Since we already know that rxy = sin(œï), we can substitute it in to get the final formulas: x=sin(œï)cos(Œ∏) and y=sin(œï)sin(Œ∏).
