<p>
You have to sign-up to login and access the course files. There is a link to the Sketchfab model, but that is no longer valid. However, the dragon model seems to be available in the direct course download.
</p>

<div id="Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Stick source to geo-Start the Scene"><h3 id="Start the Scene" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Stick source to geo-Start the Scene">Start the Scene</a></h3></div>

<p>
The tutorial starts by building the scene from scratch.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Geometry</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Rename to <code>import_dragon</code>

</ul>
<li>
Inside the <code>Geometry</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Drop and <code>Alembic</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Load in the animation file (abc):

<ul>
<li>
<code>File Name</code> and navigate to the alembic file.

</ul>
<li>
<code>Load As</code> to <code>Unpack Alembic Delayed Load Primitives</code> setting.

</ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Convert</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
The default settings should be good.

</ul>
<li>
The tutorial drops down a <code>Tommy</code> model for scale comparison:

<ul>
<li>
Scale is very important for Pyro effects.

</ul>
<li>
Add a <code>Transform</code> to the <code>Convert</code> of the alembic:

<ul>
<li>
Set the <code>Uniform Scale</code> to <code>50</code> 

</ul>
<li>
In the animation, the dragon doesn't open its mouth till later in the sequence, so to offset:

<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Timeshift</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Edit the <code>Frame</code> to <code>$FF+130</code>

<li>
<span id="Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Stick source to geo-Start the Scene-NOTE"></span><strong id="NOTE">NOTE</strong>: Take notice of the double-f - this is for sub-frames (a single 'F' would only pass on the motion on the integer frame slice.

<li>
<span id="Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Stick source to geo-Start the Scene-<em>IMPORTANT</em>"></span><strong id="<em>IMPORTANT</em>"><em>IMPORTANT</em></strong>: Uncheck the <code>Integer Frames</code> checkbox (since the simulation will be working sub-frame level).

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Null</code>:

<ul>
<li>
Rename to <code>geo_dragon</code>

<li>
Copy the null (select and copy - for the path)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Move up to the Object level and create a second <code>Geometry</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Rename to <code>FX_fire</code>

<li>
Jump inside:

<ul>
<li>
Create an <code>Object Merge</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Paste in the path from the null in the <code>import_dragon</code> container, into <code>Object 1</code> field.

<li>
At this stage, the dragon should be visible in the Viewport.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Stick source to geo-Create Source"><h3 id="Create Source" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Stick source to geo-Create Source">Create Source</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Look at the dragon head in a side view.

<li>
<code>S</code> key to go into selection mode:

<ul>
<li>
Grab the <code>Lasso</code> tool from the top bar of the Viewport.

<li>
Select around the head/skull area of the dragon:

<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Blast</code> node, and switch to <code>Delete Non-Selected</code>

<li>
You should now only see the head.

</ul>
<li>
Drop an <code>Extract Centroid</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Set the <code>Run Over</code> parameter to <code>Detail</code>

<li>
This will give us a point at the center of the selection.

<li>
We'll use this as a source position.

</ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Transform</code> node, and move the point into the mouth area:

<ul>
<li>
Template the <code>Blast</code> node to see the head

<li>
In the tutorial, the translate values were <code>0, -0.34, 0.4</code>

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Drop a free-floating <code>Sphere (Polygon)</code> node (as a source):

<ul>
<li>
Set <code>Primitive Type</code> to <code>Polygon</code>

<li>
<code>Uniform Scale</code> to 0.15

<li>
<code>Frequency</code> to 10

</ul>
<li>
Add a <code>Mountain</code> node to the <code>Sphere</code>:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Range Values</code> to <code>Zero Centered</code>

<li>
<code>Amplitude</code> to 0.1

<li>
<code>Element Size</code> to 0.15

<li>
<code>Animate Noise</code> checkbox 'On'

<li>
<code>Pulse Duration</code> to 0.35

</ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Copy to Points</code> node from the <code>Mountain</code>:

<ul>
<li>
Plug the <code>Transform</code> of the Dragon Head to <code>input 2</code> of the <code>Copy to Points</code>.

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Stick source to geo-More variation for emission chaos"><h3 id="More variation for emission chaos" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Stick source to geo-More variation for emission chaos">More variation for emission chaos</a></h3></div>

<p>
After the <code>Mountain</code> node (of the source sphere):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add a <code>Scatter</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Turn off <code>Relax Iterations</code>

<li>
<code>Force Total Count</code> to 2800

</ul>
<li>
To introduce more chaos, add an <code>Attribute Noise</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Set <code>Attribute Names</code> to <code>Float</code> and a name of <code>noise</code>:

<ul>
<li>
click on the visualizer icon after the field to see the effect in the Viewport.

</ul>
<li>
Activate the <code>Enable Remap Ramp</code>.

<li>
<code>Element Size</code> to 0.08

<li>
In the <code>Animation</code> section:

<ul>
<li>
Turn on <code>Animate Noise</code>

<li>
<code>Pulse Duration</code> to 0.25

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Blast</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
In the <code>Group</code> field add an expression to delete points:

<ul>
<li>
<code>@noise&gt;0.7</code>

<li>
<code>Group Type</code> to <code>Points</code>

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Back on the <code>Attribute Noise</code> node, we can edit the ramp to alter the point chaos.

</ul>
<div id="Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Particle simulation &amp; Velocity"><h2 id="Particle simulation &amp; Velocity" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Particle simulation &amp; Velocity">Particle simulation &amp; Velocity</a></h2></div>
<div id="Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Particle simulation &amp; Velocity-[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogzm2gnkMTU&amp;t=574s|YouTube - Particle simulation &amp; Velocity]]"><h4 id="[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogzm2gnkMTU&amp;t=574s|YouTube - Particle simulation &amp; Velocity]]" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Particle simulation &amp; Velocity-[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogzm2gnkMTU&amp;t=574s|YouTube - Particle simulation &amp; Velocity]]"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogzm2gnkMTU&amp;t=574s">YouTube - Particle simulation &amp; Velocity</a></a></h4></div>

<p>
Continuing on the emission/source object, after the point <code>Blast</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Drop an <code>Attribute VOP</code>:

<ul>
<li>
Rename to <code>set_V</code>

</ul>
<li>
Inside:

<ul>
<li>
Promote the <code>V</code> on the OUTPUT node ('geometryvopoutput1') to a <code>Constant</code>:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Constant Type</code> to <code>3 Floats (vector)</code>

<li>
Set the <code>3 Float Default</code> to <code>0, 1, 0</code> for a vertical vector.

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Up at the SOP level, click on the <code>v</code> attribute on the <code>i</code> panel of the <code>Attribute VOP</code>, and turn on the Viewport visualizer. (<code>RMB</code> to select the attribute if it doesn't show immediately.) We should see the vector trails pointing up.

</ul>
<p>
Now we have <em>a</em> direction for the points, but not aligned to the head.
</p>

<div id="Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Particle simulation &amp; Velocity-Alignment with the head"><h3 id="Alignment with the head" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Particle simulation &amp; Velocity-Alignment with the head">Alignment with the head</a></h3></div>

<p>
The strategy to align the centroid point with the direction of the head, is to pick a single vertex at the back of the dragon's mouth, and get the centroid point to 'look' at it throughout the motion.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Go to the <code>Blast</code> node after the <code>Object Merge</code>, and <code>w</code> key to go to wireframe.

<li>
<code>s</code> to select a single point in the back of the mouth, and hit <code>Delete</code>:

<ul>
<li>
This will create another <code>Blast</code> node, and we can pull this node out of the network and fork it out of the first <code>Blast</code> node, and click on <code>Delete Non Selected</code> so we are left with the single point we selected.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Now to get the centroid point to align:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
after the <code>Transform</code> (after the <code>Extract Centroid</code>) drop an <code>Attribute VOP</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Connect the output of the second <code>Blast</code> node (the single point at the back of the mouth) into <code>input 2</code>.

</ul>
<li>
Inside the <code>Attribute VOP</code>:

<ul>
<li>
From the <code>OpInput2</code> output on the INPUT ('geometryvopglobal1') node:

<ul>
<li>
Add an <code>Import Point Attribute</code> node

<li>
From this promote the <code>Import Point Attribute</code> node's <code>ptnum</code> input, to a <code>Constant</code> (zero since there's only one point).

</ul>
<li>
From the <code>P</code> output of the INPUT node:

<ul>
<li>
Add a <code>Subtract</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Plug the <code>result</code> out of the <code>Import Point Attribute</code> into input 2 of the Subtract.

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
From the <code>diff</code> output of the <code>Subtract</code>, plug into the <code>N</code> input of the OUTPUT ('geometryvopoutput1') node.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Turn on the <code>normal</code> display in the Viewport to see if the point's normal is indeed pointing out of the mouth. (Make sure the visual length of the normal is visible - and if not <code>d</code> in the Viewport to adjust the size in the <code>Guides</code> tab.)
</p>

<p>
To get the source object into alignment:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Transform</code> node after the <code>set_V</code> ('Attribute VOP') node, and rotate to align the vectors. (Probably <code>90, 0, 0</code> on the rotation fields.) 

</ul>
<div id="Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Particle simulation &amp; Velocity-Adding a POP Network"><h3 id="Adding a POP Network" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Dragon Fire Breath-Particle simulation &amp; Velocity-Adding a POP Network">Adding a POP Network</a></h3></div>

<p>
After the <code>Copy to Points</code> node:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add a <code>POP Network</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Inside:

<ul>
<li>
On the <code>source_first_input</code> ('POP Source') node:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Source</code> tab:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Emission Type</code>: to <code>All Points</code> (since we created our own points.)

</ul>
<li>
<code>Attributes</code> tab:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Initial Velocity</code> to <code>Add to inherited velocity</code>

<li>
<code>Inherit Velocity</code> slider to 15

</ul>
<li>
<code>Birth</code> tab:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Life Expectancy</code> to 0.4

<li>
<code>Life Variance</code> to 0.1:

<ul>
<li>
(This will activate the <code>Variance</code> fields. Leave at <code>1, 1, 1</code>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Try playing on the Timeline.
<table>
<tr>
<td>
The author did a lot of tests to establish the settings for 'Inherit Velocity' and the 'Life Expectancy' to get the particular look of the pyro.

<p>
Instead of an ON/OFF nature to the particle emission, it would be preferable to have a fade in and a fade out of emission.
</p>

<p>
One way of controlling this is to add a multiplier to the expression result on the <code>Blast</code> node that has the noise expression (<code>@noise&gt;0.7</code>).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On the <code>Blast</code> node parameter panel, use the <code>cog wheel</code> icon/dropdown, to select:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Edit Parameter Interface</code>:

<ul>
<li>
Add a <code>Float</code> parameter:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Name</code> to <code>anim</code>

<li>
<code>Label</code> to <code>Anim</code>

<li>
<code>Range</code> to <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>

</ul>
<li>
Close editor panel.

<li>
<code>RMB</code> on the <code>Anim</code> parameter and <code>Copy Parameter</code>

<li>
Inside the <code>Group</code> expression, replace the decimal number by deleting it and <code>RMB</code> after the expression and <code>Paste Relative Values</code>:

<ul>
<li>
<code>@noise&gt;'chs("anim")'</code>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
We can key the value on the slider to animate the flame on and off with a fade.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
On frame 12, set the lowest <code>Anim</code> value (0.1 in the tutorial). Keyframe - <code>LMB</code> on parameter to keyframe.

<li>
On frame 16, set the full value (0.6 in the tutorial). Keyframe - <code>LMB</code> on the parameter to keyframe.

<li>
On frame 39, set the full value again (0.6)

<li>
On frame 50, set min again to (0.1)

</ul>
<p>
Playback the timeline on the <code>POP Network</code> to see the result in particle emission.

<div id="Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini - Dragon Fire Breath-FAQ: Creating a Fire Breath Simulation in Houdini-1.

Why is scale important when creating VFX simulations, especially fire breath?" class="header"><a href="#Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini - Dragon Fire Breath-FAQ: Creating a Fire Breath Simulation in Houdini-1. Why is scale important when creating VFX simulations, especially fire breath?">1. Why is scale important when creating VFX simulations, especially fire breath?</a></h4></div>

<p>
Scale is crucial for realistic simulation behavior. In the context of fire breathing, if the dragon model is too small, the fire won't behave as it would in real life. A proper scale ensures accurate calculations for things like fluid dynamics, and the interaction of the fire with the environment. In the tutorial, scaling up the dragon model ensures a more realistic simulation.
</p>

<div id="Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini - Dragon Fire Breath-FAQ: Creating a Fire Breath Simulation in Houdini-2. How is the fire source created and attached to the dragon's mouth?"><h4 id="2.

How is the fire source created and attached to the dragon's mouth?">2. How is the fire source created and attached to the dragon's mouth?</a></h4></div>

<p>
First, a portion of the dragon's head geometry around the mouth is isolated. The centroid of this selected area is extracted to create a point that tracks the center of the dragon's head. This point is then offset and transformed to be accurately positioned at the dragon's mouth opening. A sphere, noised up for more chaotic appearance, is then attached to this point to serve as the source of fire particles.

<p>
The Time Shift node is used to move the animation forward in time so that the dragon's mouth is already open in the beginning of the simulation. Disabling "integer frames" in the Time Shift node is essential for ensuring smooth animation interpolation, particularly when using sub-steps in the pyro simulation. This prevents the animation from snapping between frames, which is very important when simulating and calculating collisions.

Instead of emitting all particles at once, the tutorial uses a density attribute controlled by a noise pattern to vary the points emitted at any given time, adding visual variation. A float parameter is created to control the animation of this density, creating the effect of an on/off emission. Additionally, a velocity vector pointing up and then spread through curl noise is created. The "burn" and "temperature" attributes, also noised, are attached to the particles. These attributes are later rasterized into volumes for the Pyro simulation.

How are velocities and forces handled in the simulation setup?">5. How are velocities and forces handled in the simulation setup?</a></h4></div>

<p>
A initial velocity vector that aligns with the dragon's head direction is created, using normals created from the dragon head geometry. Curl noise is added to this velocity to create a spray-like effect. In the Pyro solver, instead of adding the velocities directly, they are "pulled" using an acceleration strength. This blend method is used to avoid mushroom cloud formations and provide more controlled movement. Buoyancy is disabled to prevent smoke from rising as desired for this specific shot.

<p>
Key settings include using 8 or 3 max substeps for fast moving smoke, turning on advection reflection to preserve smoke volume, and mapping the flame range for density emission, cooling rate, and speed fields. Optimization involves using a camera frustum to delete the fields outside the view which prevents the simulation from processing things that the camera is not looking at and therefore saving computation time. Disturbance and Turbulence are mapped to speed and temperature to give the smoke more realistic features.

What is the significance of the &quot;SDF&quot; and how is it used for optimization?">8. What is the significance of the "SDF" and how is it used for optimization?</a></h4></div>

<p>
The SDF (Signed Distance Field) is derived from the camera frustum geometry, creating a volume that indicates whether the simulation is inside or outside the camera's view. This SDF is used to dynamically cut off all fields (burn, density, and temperature) outside the camera's view, preventing unnecessary computations and significantly optimizing the simulation's performance.
How are the fire and smoke rendered and composited after simulation? The fire is rendered using the pyro bake, and bindings are set to 'bake emission volume'. In Redshift, a volume shader maps scatter to density with a lower scatter coefficient and a higher absorption coefficient, and then maps the emission to flame color and intensity. The rendered passes are then comped in Nuke, with the smoke and fire merged over a ramp and lighting layers and glow effects are added. A fog layer, created from the camera frustum in Houdini, is added on top for visual depth. Finally, motion blur and a subtle flare are added to complete the shot.

<p>
These parameters dictate how far the fire is pushed, how long it lasts, and therefore dramatically affects the look of the effect. They determine the spread and behavior of the fire.
</p>

<div id="Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini VFX: Dragon Fire Breath Study Guide-Short Answer Quiz-* Why are burn and temperature attributes created on the source particles?"><h4 id="* Why are burn and temperature attributes created on the source particles?" class="header"><a href="#Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini VFX: Dragon Fire Breath Study Guide-Short Answer Quiz-* Why are burn and temperature attributes created on the source particles?">* Why are burn and temperature attributes created on the source particles?</a></h4></div>

<p>
Burn and temperature attributes are created on the source particles to control the look of the pyro simulation. These attributes determine how hot and how much fire should be emitted from the particles.
</p>

<div id="Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini VFX: Dragon Fire Breath Study Guide-Short Answer Quiz-* Why is velocity rasterized in a separate node from other attributes?"><h4 id="* Why is velocity rasterized in a separate node from other attributes?" class="header"><a href="#Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini VFX: Dragon Fire Breath Study Guide-Short Answer Quiz-* Why is velocity rasterized in a separate node from other attributes?">* Why is velocity rasterized in a separate node from other attributes?</a></h4></div>

<p>
Velocity is rasterized separately so that point velocity adjustments don't interfere with accurate velocity blur. This allows noise to be added without disrupting accurate motion blur calculations in the simulation.
</p>

<div id="Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini VFX: Dragon Fire Breath Study Guide-Short Answer Quiz-* What does &quot;advectional reflection&quot; do and why is it useful?"><h4 id="* What does &quot;advectional reflection&quot; do and why is it useful?" class="header"><a href="#Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini VFX: Dragon Fire Breath Study Guide-Short Answer Quiz-* What does &quot;advectional reflection&quot; do and why is it useful?">* What does "advectional reflection" do and why is it useful?</a></h4></div>

<p>
Advectional reflection helps to preserve the volume of the simulation, especially when there are fast-moving elements. It slows the sim down, but prevents the density from losing volume.
