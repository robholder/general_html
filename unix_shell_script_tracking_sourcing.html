<div id="Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once"><h1 id="Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once" class="header"><a href="#Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once">Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once</a></h1></div>

<p>
You can track whether a sourced script has already been run before by using environment variables or temporary files. Here are two reliable approaches:
</p>

<div id="Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use an Environment Variable (Best for Sourced Scripts)"><h2 id="Use an Environment Variable (Best for Sourced Scripts)" class="header"><a href="#Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use an Environment Variable (Best for Sourced Scripts)">Use an Environment Variable (Best for Sourced Scripts)</a></h2></div>

<p>
Since sourced scripts share the parent shell's environment, you can set a variable at the start of the script and check if it exists before running the logic again.
</p>

<p>
Example
</p>

<pre bash>
# Prevent re-sourcing
if [[ -n "$SCRIPT_ALREADY_SOURCED" ]]; then
    echo "Script has already been sourced. Skipping..."
    return
fi

# Mark script as sourced
export SCRIPT_ALREADY_SOURCED=true

# Your script logic here
echo "Running sourced script now..."
</pre>

<div id="Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use an Environment Variable (Best for Sourced Scripts)-Why This Works?"><h3 id="Why This Works?" class="header"><a href="#Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use an Environment Variable (Best for Sourced Scripts)-Why This Works?">Why This Works?</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
The variable persists until the shell session ends.

<li>
If the script is sourced again in the same session, it skips execution.

<li>
Works for sourcing (source script.sh) but not for direct execution (./script.sh).

</ul>
<div id="Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use a Temporary File (Persists Between Sessions)"><h2 id="Use a Temporary File (Persists Between Sessions)" class="header"><a href="#Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use a Temporary File (Persists Between Sessions)">Use a Temporary File (Persists Between Sessions)</a></h2></div>

<p>
If you want to track runs across different shell sessions, a temp file can be useful.
</p>

<p>
Example
</p>

<pre bash>
# Define a tracking file
TRACK_FILE="/tmp/script_sourced.lock"

# Check if the file exists
if [[ -f "$TRACK_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "Script has already been sourced. Skipping..."
    return
fi

# Mark script as sourced
touch "$TRACK_FILE"

# Your script logic here
echo "Running sourced script now..."
</pre>

<div id="Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use a Temporary File (Persists Between Sessions)-Why This Works?"><h3 id="Why This Works?" class="header"><a href="#Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use a Temporary File (Persists Between Sessions)-Why This Works?">Why This Works?</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Works across multiple shell sessions.

<li>
Ensures the script is only sourced once, even if the user opens a new terminal.

<li>
You can reset it manually with: <code>rm /tmp/script_sourced.lock</code>.

</ul>
<div id="Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use a Temporary File (Persists Between Sessions)-Which Method Should You Use?"><h3 id="Which Method Should You Use?" class="header"><a href="#Ensure a Script is Sourced Only Once-Use a Temporary File (Persists Between Sessions)-Which Method Should You Use?">Which Method Should You Use?</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
 Use environment variables if tracking only within the current shell session. 

<li>
 Use a temp file if tracking across multiple shell sessions.

</ul>
