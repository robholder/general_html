<div id="Restructure a Repo"><h1 id="Restructure a Repo" class="header"><a href="#Restructure a Repo">Restructure a Repo</a></h1></div>

<p>
Here’s a concise, step-by-step process to completely re-order your repository’s file and directory structure locally so that the changes are reflected when you push to GitHub:
</p>

<div id="Restructure a Repo-Plan Your New Structure:"><h2 id="Plan Your New Structure:" class="header"><a href="#Restructure a Repo-Plan Your New Structure:">Plan Your New Structure:</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Outline the changes you’d like to make (e.g., moving files into new directories, renaming folders) so you know what moves to perform.

</ul>
<div id="Restructure a Repo-Use git mv for Trackable Moves:"><h2 id="Use git mv for Trackable Moves:" class="header"><a href="#Restructure a Repo-Use git mv for Trackable Moves:">Use git mv for Trackable Moves:</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Use the <code>git mv</code> command to move and rename files and directories. For example:
<pre bash>
git mv old_dir new_dir
git mv new_dir/old_file.txt new_dir/new_file.txt
</pre>

<li>
Using <code>git mv</code> ensures that Git recognizes these changes as moves, preserving history where possible.

</ul>
<div id="Restructure a Repo-Manually Move Files (Optional):"><h2 id="Manually Move Files (Optional):" class="header"><a href="#Restructure a Repo-Manually Move Files (Optional):">Manually Move Files (Optional):</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
If you need to move things with your file manager, you can do that too, but you must then stage the changes:
<pre bash>
git add -A
</pre>

<li>
Git will detect moved files as deletes and adds, which is fine though not as neat as using <code>git mv</code>.

</ul>
<div id="Restructure a Repo-Review the Changes:"><h2 id="Review the Changes:" class="header"><a href="#Restructure a Repo-Review the Changes:">Review the Changes:</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Run <code>git status</code> to check the list of changes. Confirm that files are showing up as “renamed” or “moved” as expected.

</ul>
<div id="Restructure a Repo-Commit Your Reorganization:"><h2 id="Commit Your Reorganization:" class="header"><a href="#Restructure a Repo-Commit Your Reorganization:">Commit Your Reorganization:</a></h2></div>

<p>
Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message:
</p>

<pre bash>
git commit -m "Completely re-order repository file/directory structure"
</pre>

<div id="Restructure a Repo-Push Your Changes:"><h2 id="Push Your Changes:" class="header"><a href="#Restructure a Repo-Push Your Changes:">Push Your Changes:</a></h2></div>

<p>
Once committed, push the changes to your remote repository:
</p>

<pre bash>
git push
</pre>

<p>
This will update the GitHub repository with the new file and directory structure.
</p>

<div id="Restructure a Repo-Post-Push Verification:"><h2 id="Post-Push Verification:" class="header"><a href="#Restructure a Repo-Post-Push Verification:">Post-Push Verification:</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Optionally, verify on GitHub (or by cloning the repo into a new directory) that the changes have been applied successfully.

<li>
Following these steps will allow you to safely re-order your repository’s structure locally, with Git tracking all the moves, so that when you push, GitHub reflects your updated organization.

</ul>
<div id="Regular Directory and File Creation"><h1 id="Regular Directory and File Creation" class="header"><a href="#Regular Directory and File Creation">Regular Directory and File Creation</a></h1></div>

<p>
You can create directories and files using standard filesystem tools like <code>mkdir</code> and your favorite text editor. Here are some points to consider:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Regular Directory and File Creation-Creating Directories"></span><strong id="Creating Directories">Creating Directories</strong>: Use <code>mkdir</code> to create directories. For example:
<pre bash>
mkdir new_directory
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
However, remember that Git only tracks files, not empty directories. If you create an empty folder, Git won't include it in commits. A common workaround is to add a placeholder file (like .gitkeep) inside empty directories.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Regular Directory and File Creation-Creating Files"></span><strong id="Creating Files">Creating Files</strong>: You can create files using commands like touch or any editor:
<pre bash>
touch new_directory/new_file.txt
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
...or open the file in your favorite text editor and save it.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Regular Directory and File Creation-Tracking Changes in Git"></span><strong id="Tracking Changes in Git">Tracking Changes in Git</strong>: After creating your directories and files, you need to add them to Git using:
<pre bash>
git add -A
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
Then, commit your changes:
</p>

<pre bash>
git commit -m "Created new directories and files"
</pre>

<p>
Finally, push the commit to your remote repository.
</p>


<p>
In summary, you can freely use <code>mkdir</code> and other tools to organize your project. Just remember to stage and commit the changes so that Git tracks them properly.
