<p>
I use two external thumb drives with two Macbooks - one using iTunes, and the other using the replacement app, 'Music'.
</p>

<div id="Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-iTunes"><h2 id="iTunes" class="header"><a href="#Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-iTunes">iTunes</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
On an Intel Mac, I use iTunes, and the library is stored normally on the Macbook's internal hard drive.

<li>
I backup the library on a thumbdrive, which virtually mirrors the iTunes Database or Folder/File system.

</ul>
<div id="Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-Music"><h2 id="Music" class="header"><a href="#Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-Music">Music</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
On a Silicon M3 Macbook, I use 'Music', but I store its library directly on a thumbdrive, and plug that in before launch of 'Music'.

<li>
I can add music files by draging and dropping onto the Music app, and the music gets stored on the thumbdrive.

<li>
Problem:

<ul>
<li>
Every time I quit 'Music' and try to eject the thumbdrive, I get a 'Could not eject' notice.

</ul>
</ul>

I tried Copilot, and got this response:

You can use the <code>lsof</code> command in Terminal to reveal which process is using the disk. Here's how you can do it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Open Terminal (found in Applications &gt; Utilities).

<li>
Type the following command, replacing 'YourDriveName' with the name of your external drive:

<ul>
<li>
<code>sudo lsof /Volumes/YourDriveName</code>

</ul>
<li>
Press <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code>.

<ul>
<li>
You will be prompted to enter your admin password. Type your password (it won't be visible) and press Enter again.

<li>
This command will list all the processes that have open files on the specified volume, helping you identify which process is using the disk

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
In my case, I find two processes listed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>mds</code>

<li>
<code>AMPLibrar</code>

</ul>

</ul>
<p>
You can terminate these processes using the <code>kill</code> command in Terminal. Here's how you can do it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Open Terminal: You can find Terminal in Applications &gt; Utilities.

<li>
Find the Process IDs (PIDs): Use the <code>lsof</code> command you used earlier to find the PIDs of the processes. For example:

<ul>
<li>
<code>sudo lsof /Volumes/YourDriveName</code>

</ul>
<li>
Terminate the Processes:

<ul>
<li>
Use the kill command followed by the PID of each process.

<li>
For example, if the PID of <code>mds</code> is 1234 and the PID of <code>AMPLibrar</code> is 5678, you would run:

<ul>
<li>
<code>sudo kill 1234</code> (Use the PID you get from the <code>lsof</code>)

<li>
<code>sudo kill 5678</code> (Use the PID you get from the <code>lsof</code>)

</ul>
<li>
If the processes don't terminate with the kill command (in my experience, they did), you can use the <code>kill -9</code> command, which forcefully terminates the processes:

<ul>
<li>
<code>sudo kill -9 1234</code> (Use the PID you get from the <code>lsof</code>)

<li>
<code>sudo kill -9 5678</code> (Use the PID you get from the <code>lsof</code>)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
This should help you safely eject your external drive.

Let's imagine the problem process is the Quicklook process.
</p>

<p>
You can temporarily kill the Quicklook process so it releases its hold on your external drive. Here are a couple of methods:
</p>

<div id="Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-Another Example:-Method 1: Using Activity Monitor"><h3 id="Method 1: Using Activity Monitor" class="header"><a href="#Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-Another Example:-Method 1: Using Activity Monitor">Method 1: Using Activity Monitor</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Open Activity Monitor (found in Applications → Utilities).

<li>
In the search box, type “Quicklook” to filter the processes.

<li>
Select the Quicklook process (it might appear as QuickLook or QuickLookUIHelper).

<li>
Click the “X” button in the toolbar, then choose Force Quit.

</ul>
<div id="Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-Another Example:-Method 2: Using Terminal"><h3 id="Method 2: Using Terminal" class="header"><a href="#Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-Another Example:-Method 2: Using Terminal">Method 2: Using Terminal</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Open the Terminal application.

<li>
Run the following command to kill Quicklook immediately:
<pre bash>
killall QuickLook
# or
# Where &lt;pid&gt; is given in the lsof command:
killall &lt;pid&gt;
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
If the process refuses to quit, force it with:
</p>

<pre bash>
killall -9 QuickLook
#or
# Where &lt;pid&gt; is given in the lsof command:
killall -9 &lt;pid&gt;
</pre>

<p>
(Ensure you use the exact process name as it appears in your system. Sometimes it might be “QuickLookUIHelper” or “quicklookd”—adjust the command accordingly.)
</p>

<p>
Once the process is terminated, try ejecting your external drive again. Keep in mind that macOS may restart Quicklook when needed, but this temporary kill should let you eject your drive without the interference.

<div id="Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-Extra Info"><h2 id="Extra Info" class="header"><a href="#Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-Extra Info">Extra Info</a></h2></div>

<p>
The <span id="Music App &amp; Ejecting External Drives-Extra Info-<em>AMPLibraryAgent</em>"></span><strong id="<em>AMPLibraryAgent</em>"><em>AMPLibraryAgent</em></strong> process is a part of MacOS that manages the media library for the Music app and the TV app. It's a per-user daemon that handles tasks related to your media library, such as organizing and updating your music and video files.
</p>

<p>
If you need to terminate the process, you can use the kill command in Terminal, as mentioned earlier. However, keep in mind that this process is essential for the proper functioning of the Music and TV apps, so it will likely restart automatically.
