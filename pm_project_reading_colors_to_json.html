I want to get a list of common colors in a sequence of images. I'm bringing in sequences of images with around 30 colors per sequence (they are comic book style). I want to make a json list of RGB colors. I can do this in Nuke using the 'sample' method in Python, but it's slow. Can I use some other tool (inside or outside Nuke) to achieve this more efficiently and faster. For example I've heard the 'Open Image IO' may be faster. I'm open to any ideas.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The slow performance of Nuke's Python sample method is a common issue because it incurs overhead from the Nuke evaluation engine. To achieve this more efficiently and faster, you should move the image processing outside of the Nuke Python API and use high-performance, dedicated Python libraries.
</p>

<p>
The best approach for finding a limited set of dominant colors is to use a Machine Learning/Statistical Clustering method, specifically K-Means Clustering, which is highly optimized in popular scientific libraries.
</p>

<p>
Here is the most efficient solution, combining fast I/O and statistical processing:

<p>
This method is significantly faster because it uses optimized C/C++ backend libraries (like NumPy) for file reading and computation, bypassing Nuke's slower internal Python wrappers.

<p>
Since your images are "comic book style" with a naturally limited number of distinct colors (around 30), K-Means Clustering is the ideal algorithm.

I won't know the number of colors for each image sequence, but I know they will be relatively low in number. How can I change the code to expect any number of colors?

<p>
That's a key challenge when using K-Means Clustering! If you don't know the optimal number of clusters (K), you need an automated way to estimate it for each frame.
</p>

<p>
You can modify the code to use the Elbow Method to dynamically determine the best K for a given image, making the process adaptive to your comic book style sequences.
</p>

<div id="Reading Colors to JSON-The Strategy: The Elbow Method 📐"><h2 id="The Strategy: The Elbow Method 📐" class="header"><a href="#Reading Colors to JSON-The Strategy: The Elbow Method 📐">The Strategy: The Elbow Method 📐</a></h2></div>

<p>
The Elbow Method is a heuristic used to find the optimal number of clusters (K) in K-Means.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Reading Colors to JSON-The Strategy: The Elbow Method 📐-Calculate Distortion"></span><strong id="Calculate Distortion">Calculate Distortion</strong>: Run K-Means multiple times, increasing K (e.g., from 5 to 50). For each run, record the distortion (the sum of squared distances between each point and its assigned centroid).

The distortion will decrease sharply as K increases, then slow down dramatically. The point where the curve bends, resembling an "elbow," is the optimal number of clusters, as adding more clusters provides diminishing returns.

</ul>
<p>
Since your color counts are low (around 30), we can define a reasonable search range for K.

I believe the RGB values would need to be in the same units/representation as used in Nuke - zero to one for standard black to white (while HDR images are possible). Would I forego the conversion to 0 - 255?

<p>
Yes, you are absolutely correct and should forego the conversion to the 0-255 range if you intend to use the resulting RGB values directly within Nuke (or any standard VFX application). 💡
</p>

<p>
Nuke and OpenEXR/HDR pipelines natively operate on floating-point color values where standard dynamic range is represented by 0.0 to 1.0.

<p>
You need to ensure two things in your processing pipeline:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Reading Colors to JSON-The Necessary Adjustment to the Code-Image Read"></span><strong id="Image Read">Image Read</strong>: The image data is loaded directly as floating-point numbers.

</ul>
<p>
If you are using OpenImageIO (OIIO), this is much simpler as it defaults to reading data as float (or whatever the file precision is) and gives you the 0.0−1.0 data naturally. If you are using OpenCV or Pillow, you must explicitly ensure the conversion to float and division by 255 does not happen, or handle the data type correctly.

When reading, OIIO will automatically convert the integer-based data from 8-bit or 16-bit TGA/PNG files into the 0.0 to 1.0 floating-point range (or higher for HDR files like OpenEXR). This eliminates the need for manual normalization steps like dividing by 255.0

</ul>
<p>
Yes, the colorspace settings on the Nuke Read node will absolutely affect the pixel values read into the scene. ⚠️ This is a crucial consideration for your color extraction script.
</p>

<p>
The goal in a Nuke pipeline is usually to convert all incoming image data into a single, standardized Working Colorspace (often linear sRGB/Rec. 709 or ACEScg). The Read node performs this conversion.

<p>
The Nuke Read node is responsible for two main actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Reading Colors to JSON-Corrected Code Snippet using OpenCV (If Used)-How Nuke Read Nodes Affect Pixel Values-Reading Data"></span><strong id="Reading Data">Reading Data</strong>: It takes the raw digital values from the file (e.g., the 8-bit integer data from a PNG or TGA).

<li>
<span id="Reading Colors to JSON-Corrected Code Snippet using OpenCV (If Used)-How Nuke Read Nodes Affect Pixel Values-Colorspace Transformation"></span><strong id="Colorspace Transformation">Colorspace Transformation</strong>: It applies a color transformation to convert the file's native colorspace (e.g., sRGB, Rec. 709, or Log) into the scene's working colorspace (usually linear).

<p>
If you run your Python script on the image before it enters Nuke (as intended with OIIO), your script is operating on the file's native colorspace data (e.g., sRGB).
</p>

<p>
If you were to sample the colors inside Nuke (e.g., using an expression or Python in the Nuke script itself), the values you get would be the linearized values.

<p>
The colorspace transformation means that the floating-point RGB values you extract from the raw files (which are in the sRGB/Rec. 709 gamma space) will NOT numerically match the pixel values you see in the Nuke Viewer or are used by Nuke nodes (which are in the linear space), except for pure black (0,0,0) and pure white (1,1,1).

<p>
For maximum accuracy and consistency with the Nuke scene, you should perform your K-Means clustering in linear color space.
</p>

<p>
This means you need to modify your image loading/preprocessing to perform the same colorspace transformation that Nuke is doing:

<p>
If you are confident your image files are standard sRGB (which most PNGs and JPEGs are):
</p>

<pre python>
def read_image_and_linearize(file_path):
    # 1. Load Image using OIIO (assumes 0.0-1.0 non-linear data)
    img_non_linear = read_image_with_oiio(file_path) 
    
    # 2. Linearize the data using the inverse sRGB EOTF (roughly a power 2.2 function)
    # The simple power 2.2 is a good approximation for sRGB/Rec. 709:
    # Value_Linear = Value_Non_Linear ^ 2.2
    
    # We apply the power function to only the color channels (R, G, B)
    # np.power(img_non_linear, 2.2) is the standard approximation
    img_linear = np.power(img_non_linear, 2.2) 
    
    return img_linear # The data is now in the Nuke working space
    
# In your main extraction function:
# pixels = img_float_data.reshape((-1, 3))  &lt;-- CHANGE THIS
img_linear_data = read_image_and_linearize(file_path)
pixels = img_linear_data.reshape((-1, 3))
</pre>

<p>
This approach ensures that your extracted dominant colors are numerically equivalent to the colors that Nuke is actually using for compositing, which is usually what you want.

<p>
That's a very common constraint in production environments! 😫
</p>

<p>
Yes, there is an alternative to using NumPy and scikit-learn's MiniBatchKMeans for K-Means clustering, but it will require writing the clustering logic yourself using only Nuke's native Python libraries and basic data structures.
</p>

<p>
Since you can't install NumPy, you also won't be able to use the scipy.spatial or the numpy.power functions mentioned in the previous solutions.

You can implement a basic, unoptimized K-Means algorithm using only core Python libraries. This will be slower than the NumPy/scikit-learn version, but it is necessary if external libraries are forbidden.

<p>
Calculating the full Elbow Method in pure Python for a large number of frames would be very slow. Since you know the number of colors is low, you can use a fast heuristic instead of a full cluster analysis:

<p>
Instead of relying on the mathematical "elbow," you could define a narrow, reasonable search range (e.g., K=10 to K=30) and simply check a few common K values, perhaps picking the one that provides a high-enough compression ratio or the one that minimizes the distortion per pixel most effectively.
</p>

<p>
A simpler approach for production is to pre-set a maximum K value (e.g., K=30) and rely on the fact that K-Means will naturally group similar colors even if you request more clusters than strictly necessary.

|Sorry, I don't think I communicated my question well enough. Your answer is very useful however! I think I can use this information.
The better framed question would be, can I implement the colorspace conversion from the JSON color sets and Nuke's Node Graph colors without an additional library in Nuke's standard Python libraries?|

I apologize for misinterpreting the initial constraint. Your question is perfectly clear now: Can you perform the color space conversion (linear to display) within Nuke's Python environment without using an external library like NumPy?
</p>

<p>
The answer is Yes, absolutely. You can use the built-in math module and core Python functions to achieve the same result as NumPy for the sRGB linearization inverse (the View Transform).

<p>
If you need a more robust, OCIO-aware solution—one that respects Nuke's actual project settings (which may not be a simple power 2.2)—you can use Nuke's internal color conversion functions. This is the most accurate way to match the Nuke Viewer, as it utilizes the exact Viewer Process configuration.
</p>

<p>
The function you would use is nuke.to and nuke.from:
</p>

<pre python>
# WARNING: This method is highly accurate but slightly more complex.
# The 'to' and 'from' commands are primarily used for getting/setting metadata,
# but can be adapted for color conversion if needed, though the simple 
# math.pow() is usually sufficient for tile_color.

# For simplicity and performance, stick to the math.pow() method above 
# unless your pipeline uses a custom view transform that deviates significantly from sRGB.

<p>
<span id="Reading Colors to JSON-Pure Python K-Means Function-Using Nuke's Native Color Functions (Advanced)-Conclusion"></span><strong id="Conclusion">Conclusion</strong>: Stick with the math.pow() approach for setting node colors.
