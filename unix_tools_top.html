<div id="Top"><h1 id="Top" class="header"><a href="#Top">Top</a></h1></div>

<p>
The <code>top</code> command is an interactive, real‑time utility that displays a dynamic overview of your system’s processes along with summary information about CPU, memory, and swap usage. It’s commonly used to monitor performance, diagnose system slowdowns, and view resource‐intensive tasks.
</p>

<p>
Below is a breakdown of its primary features, usage, and common options:
</p>

<div id="Top-What Is It For?"><h3 id="What Is It For?" class="header"><a href="#Top-What Is It For?">What Is It For?</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-What Is It For?-Real-Time System Monitoring"></span><strong id="Real-Time System Monitoring">Real-Time System Monitoring</strong>: top shows you a continuously updated display of the processes that are actively running on your system. It provides an overview of the system load, CPU usage, memory consumption, and other system-wide statistics.

<li>
<span id="Top-What Is It For?-Process Management"></span><strong id="Process Management">Process Management</strong>: The tool lists processes with details such as process ID (PID), user, priority, CPU and memory usage, and the command that started the process. It helps you quickly identify which tasks are consuming the most resources.

<li>
<span id="Top-What Is It For?-Interactivity"></span><strong id="Interactivity">Interactivity</strong>: Within the top interface, you can interactively sort processes (by CPU, memory, etc.), filter processes by user, renice processes, or even kill processes. Key commands include:

<ul>
<li>
<code>q</code> to quit

<li>
<code>h</code> or ? to bring up a help screen

<li>
<code>k</code> to kill a process

<li>
<code>r</code> to renice a process (see below)

<li>
<code>u</code> to filter by user

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Top-How to Use It"><h3 id="How to Use It" class="header"><a href="#Top-How to Use It">How to Use It</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Basic Invocation: Simply type top in a terminal to start it:
<pre bash>
top
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
Once running, the screen splits into two sections:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-How to Use It-Summary Area (Header)"></span><strong id="Summary Area (Header)">Summary Area (Header)</strong>: Contains overall system information—uptime, load average, total task statistics, CPU(s) breakdown (user, system, idle, etc.), memory, and swap usage.

<li>
<span id="Top-How to Use It-Process List"></span><strong id="Process List">Process List</strong>: A continually updated list of individual processes, typically sorted by CPU usage by default.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-How to Use It-Interactive Commands"></span><strong id="Interactive Commands">Interactive Commands</strong>: While top is running, you can press keys (without the need to exit and restart the program) to change the display:

<ul>
<li>
Sorting by different metrics (press, for example, P for CPU or M for memory)

<li>
Filtering by processes belonging to a particular user (u)

<li>
Hiding idle processes

<li>
And many more—check the on-screen help with h for a comprehensive list.

</ul>
<div id="Top-Common Command-Line Options"><h2 id="Common Command-Line Options" class="header"><a href="#Top-Common Command-Line Options">Common Command-Line Options</a></h2></div>

<p>
Depending on the version (especially between Linux’s procps-ng and other UNIX/BSD versions), the available options may differ slightly. Here are some widely used ones:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>-b</code> (Batch Mode): Run <code>top</code> in non-interactive mode. This is useful for scripting or logging the output because the information is printed to standard output instead of being displayed interactively.
<pre bash>
top -b
</pre>

<li>
<code>-n [number]</code> (Number of Iterations): Used with -b, it specifies how many iterations (refresh cycles) top should produce before exiting.
<pre bash>
top -b -n 3
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
This will print three snapshots of the system’s statistics.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-d [seconds]</code> (Delay Between Updates): Sets the delay time in seconds between each screen update. For example:
<pre bash>
top -d 2
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
...updates every two seconds.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-u [username]</code> (User Filter): Displays only the processes of the specified user.
<pre bash>
top -u alice
</pre>

<li>
<code>-p [pid list]</code> (Monitor Specific PIDs): Allows you to monitor only specific processes by providing a comma-separated list of process IDs.
<pre bash>
top -p 1234,5678
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
Other options and interactive commands may be available depending on your system’s implementation of top. You can usually access the manual page with:
</p>

<pre bash>
man top
</pre>

<div id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios"><h2 id="Practical Usage Scenarios" class="header"><a href="#Top-Practical Usage Scenarios">Practical Usage Scenarios</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Quick Check of System Load"></span><strong id="Quick Check of System Load">Quick Check of System Load</strong>: Simply running <code>top</code> gives you an at-a-glance look at how busy your system is, which processes are consuming the most CPU, and how your memory is being used.

<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Troubleshooting Performance Issues"></span><strong id="Troubleshooting Performance Issues">Troubleshooting Performance Issues</strong>: If your system is slow or unresponsive, you can use <code>top</code> to identify any runaway processes or applications hogging resources.

<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Logging or Automated Monitoring"></span><strong id="Logging or Automated Monitoring">Logging or Automated Monitoring</strong>: When combined with the <code>-b</code> and <code>-n</code> options, <code>top</code> can be scheduled (via cron jobs, for example) to log system performance over time.

<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Interactive Process Management"></span><strong id="Interactive Process Management">Interactive Process Management</strong>: You can renice processes to adjust their scheduling priority, or kill processes directly from the top interface, which is especially helpful for administrators managing system load.

</ul>
<p>
The <code>top</code> command is a fundamental tool for system monitoring and process management, and its real-time, interactive capabilities make it invaluable for both everyday use and troubleshooting. Experimenting with its interactive commands and options can give you deeper insights into system performance on your machine.

<div id="What is meant by 'renice'?"><h1 id="What is meant by 'renice'?" class="header"><a href="#What is meant by 'renice'?">What is meant by 'renice'?</a></h1></div>

<p>
The term "renice" refers to the process of changing the "nice value" (priority) of a running process in Unix-like operating systems.
</p>

<div id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?"><h3 id="What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?" class="header"><a href="#What is meant by 'renice'?-What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?">What Is the "Nice" Value?</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?-Nice value"></span><strong id="Nice value">Nice value</strong>: Every process has a numerical niceness value that influences its scheduling priority. The value ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). A lower nice value means the process is considered less "nice" to its peers (i.e., it gets more CPU time), while a higher value means it’s more "nice" (i.e., it yields CPU time to other processes).

<li>
<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?-Default Behavior"></span><strong id="Default Behavior">Default Behavior</strong>: When a process starts, it receives a default nice value (usually 0). Regular users can typically only increase (make "nicer") this value, meaning they can lower the process's priority. To lower a process's nice value (i.e., raise its priority), root or an administrator’s privileges are usually required.

</ul>
<div id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Does &quot;Renice&quot; Do?"><h3 id="What Does &quot;Renice&quot; Do?" class="header"><a href="#What is meant by 'renice'?-What Does &quot;Renice&quot; Do?">What Does "Renice" Do?</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Does &quot;Renice&quot; Do?-Renice Operation"></span><strong id="Renice Operation">Renice Operation</strong>: The renice command allows you to change the nice value of a process (or multiple processes) that is already running. This is useful for adjusting system performance or priorities on the fly. For example, if a particular process is hogging CPU resources, you might "renice" it to a higher nice value so that it runs with lower priority.

<li>
<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Does &quot;Renice&quot; Do?-Command Syntax"></span><strong id="Command Syntax">Command Syntax</strong>: A typical usage might look like this:
<pre bash>
renice 10 -p 1234
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
This command changes the nice value of the process with PID 1234 to 10.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Does &quot;Renice&quot; Do?-Multiple Processes"></span><strong id="Multiple Processes">Multiple Processes</strong>: You can also renice multiple processes at once by supplying a list of PIDs or using other options to select processes.

</ul>
<div id="What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases"><h3 id="Practical Use Cases" class="header"><a href="#What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases">Practical Use Cases</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Reducing Priority of Background Tasks"></span><strong id="Reducing Priority of Background Tasks">Reducing Priority of Background Tasks</strong>: If you’re running a CPU-intensive task in the background (like a large file backup or data processing job), you might increase its nice value so it doesn’t interfere with interactive tasks.

<li>
<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Increasing Priority for Critical Tasks"></span><strong id="Increasing Priority for Critical Tasks">Increasing Priority for Critical Tasks</strong>: Conversely, if a process is critical and you need it to run faster, you could lower its nice value (if you have the necessary privileges) so that the system scheduler gives it more CPU time.

</ul>
<div id="What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Example"><h4 id="Example" class="header"><a href="#What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Example">Example</a></h4></div>

<p>
Suppose you have a long-running process with PID 5678 that’s slowing down your system. To make it more "nice" (i.e., reduce its priority), you could run:
</p>

<pre bash>
renice 15 -p 5678
</pre>

<p>
This command tells the scheduler to treat the process with PID 5678 as less urgent, letting other interactive processes get more CPU time.
</p>

<div id="What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Summary"><h4 id="Summary" class="header"><a href="#What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Summary">Summary</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
"Renice" means adjusting the nice value—i.e., the scheduling priority—of a running process.

<li>
It’s accomplished using the <code>renice</code> command.

<li>
Changing priorities can help manage workloads and ensure critical tasks receive sufficient CPU time.

</ul>
<p>

</p>

<pre bash>
man renice
</pre>
