<div id="Top"><h1 id="Top" class="header"><a href="#Top">Top</a></h1></div>

<p>
The <code>top</code> command is an interactive, real‑time utility that displays a dynamic overview of your system’s processes along with summary information about CPU, memory, and swap usage. It’s commonly used to monitor performance, diagnose system slowdowns, and view resource‐intensive tasks.
</p>

<p>
Below is a breakdown of its primary features, usage, and common options:
</p>

<div id="Top-What Is It For?"><h3 id="What Is It For?" class="header"><a href="#Top-What Is It For?">What Is It For?</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-What Is It For?-Real-Time System Monitoring"></span><strong id="Real-Time System Monitoring">Real-Time System Monitoring</strong>: top shows you a continuously updated display of the processes that are actively running on your system. It provides an overview of the system load, CPU usage, memory consumption, and other system-wide statistics.

<li>
<span id="Top-What Is It For?-Process Management"></span><strong id="Process Management">Process Management</strong>: The tool lists processes with details such as process ID (PID), user, priority, CPU and memory usage, and the command that started the process. It helps you quickly identify which tasks are consuming the most resources.

<li>
<span id="Top-What Is It For?-Interactivity"></span><strong id="Interactivity">Interactivity</strong>: Within the top interface, you can interactively sort processes (by CPU, memory, etc.), filter processes by user, renice processes, or even kill processes. Key commands include:

<ul>
<li>
<code>q</code> to quit

<li>
<code>h</code> or ? to bring up a help screen

<li>
<code>k</code> to kill a process

<li>
<code>r</code> to renice a process

<li>
<code>u</code> to filter by user

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Top-How to Use It"><h3 id="How to Use It" class="header"><a href="#Top-How to Use It">How to Use It</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Basic Invocation: Simply type top in a terminal to start it:
<pre bash>
top
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
Once running, the screen splits into two sections:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-How to Use It-Summary Area (Header)"></span><strong id="Summary Area (Header)">Summary Area (Header)</strong>: Contains overall system information—uptime, load average, total task statistics, CPU(s) breakdown (user, system, idle, etc.), memory, and swap usage.

<li>
<span id="Top-How to Use It-Process List"></span><strong id="Process List">Process List</strong>: A continually updated list of individual processes, typically sorted by CPU usage by default.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-How to Use It-Interactive Commands"></span><strong id="Interactive Commands">Interactive Commands</strong>: While top is running, you can press keys (without the need to exit and restart the program) to change the display:

<ul>
<li>
Sorting by different metrics (press, for example, P for CPU or M for memory)

<li>
Filtering by processes belonging to a particular user (u)

<li>
Hiding idle processes

<li>
And many more—check the on-screen help with h for a comprehensive list.

</ul>

<p>
Depending on the version (especially between Linux’s procps-ng and other UNIX/BSD versions), the available options may differ slightly. Here are some widely used ones:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>-b</code> (Batch Mode): Run <code>top</code> in non-interactive mode. This is useful for scripting or logging the output because the information is printed to standard output instead of being displayed interactively.
<pre bash>
top -b
</pre>

<li>
<code>-n [number]</code> (Number of Iterations): Used with -b, it specifies how many iterations (refresh cycles) top should produce before exiting.
<pre bash>
top -b -n 3
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
This will print three snapshots of the system’s statistics.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-d [seconds]</code> (Delay Between Updates): Sets the delay time in seconds between each screen update. For example:
<pre bash>
top -d 2
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
...updates every two seconds.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-u [username]</code> (User Filter): Displays only the processes of the specified user.
<pre bash>
top -u alice
</pre>

<li>
<code>-p [pid list]</code> (Monitor Specific PIDs): Allows you to monitor only specific processes by providing a comma-separated list of process IDs.
<pre bash>
top -p 1234,5678
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
Other options and interactive commands may be available depending on your system’s implementation of top. You can usually access the manual page with:
</p>

<pre bash>
man top
</pre>

<div id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios"><h2 id="Practical Usage Scenarios" class="header"><a href="#Top-Practical Usage Scenarios">Practical Usage Scenarios</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Quick Check of System Load"></span><strong id="Quick Check of System Load">Quick Check of System Load</strong>: Simply running <code>top</code> gives you an at-a-glance look at how busy your system is, which processes are consuming the most CPU, and how your memory is being used.

<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Troubleshooting Performance Issues"></span><strong id="Troubleshooting Performance Issues">Troubleshooting Performance Issues</strong>: If your system is slow or unresponsive, you can use <code>top</code> to identify any runaway processes or applications hogging resources.

<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Logging or Automated Monitoring"></span><strong id="Logging or Automated Monitoring">Logging or Automated Monitoring</strong>: When combined with the <code>-b</code> and <code>-n</code> options, <code>top</code> can be scheduled (via cron jobs, for example) to log system performance over time.

<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Interactive Process Management"></span><strong id="Interactive Process Management">Interactive Process Management</strong>: You can renice processes to adjust their scheduling priority, or kill processes directly from the top interface, which is especially helpful for administrators managing system load.

</ul>
<p>
The <code>top</code> command is a fundamental tool for system monitoring and process management, and its real-time, interactive capabilities make it invaluable for both everyday use and troubleshooting. Experimenting with its interactive commands and options can give you deeper insights into system performance on your machine.
