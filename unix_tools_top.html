<p>
The <code>top</code> command is an interactive, real‑time utility that displays a dynamic overview of your system’s processes along with summary information about CPU, memory, and swap usage. It’s commonly used to monitor performance, diagnose system slowdowns, and view resource‐intensive tasks.
</p>

<p>
Below is a breakdown of its primary features, usage, and common options:
</p>

<div id="Top-What Is It For?"><h3 id="What Is It For?" class="header"><a href="#Top-What Is It For?">What Is It For?</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-What Is It For?-Real-Time System Monitoring"></span><strong id="Real-Time System Monitoring">Real-Time System Monitoring</strong>: top shows you a continuously updated display of the processes that are actively running on your system. It provides an overview of the system load, CPU usage, memory consumption, and other system-wide statistics.

<li>
<span id="Top-What Is It For?-Process Management"></span><strong id="Process Management">Process Management</strong>: The tool lists processes with details such as process ID (PID), user, priority, CPU and memory usage, and the command that started the process. It helps you quickly identify which tasks are consuming the most resources.

<li>
<span id="Top-What Is It For?-Interactivity"></span><strong id="Interactivity">Interactivity</strong>: Within the top interface, you can interactively sort processes (by CPU, memory, etc.), filter processes by user, renice processes, or even kill processes. Key commands include:

<ul>
<li>
<code>q</code> to quit

<li>
<code>h</code> or ? to bring up a help screen

<li>
<code>k</code> to kill a process

<li>
<code>r</code> to renice a process (see below)

<li>
<code>u</code> to filter by user

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Top-How to Use It"><h3 id="How to Use It" class="header"><a href="#Top-How to Use It">How to Use It</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Basic Invocation: Simply type top in a terminal to start it:
<pre bash>
top
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
Once running, the screen splits into two sections:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-How to Use It-Summary Area (Header)"></span><strong id="Summary Area (Header)">Summary Area (Header)</strong>: Contains overall system information—uptime, load average, total task statistics, CPU(s) breakdown (user, system, idle, etc.), memory, and swap usage.

<li>
<span id="Top-How to Use It-Process List"></span><strong id="Process List">Process List</strong>: A continually updated list of individual processes, typically sorted by CPU usage by default.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-How to Use It-Interactive Commands"></span><strong id="Interactive Commands">Interactive Commands</strong>: While top is running, you can press keys (without the need to exit and restart the program) to change the display:

<ul>
<li>
Sorting by different metrics (press, for example, P for CPU or M for memory)

<li>
Filtering by processes belonging to a particular user (u)

<li>
Hiding idle processes

<li>
And many more—check the on-screen help with h for a comprehensive list.

</ul>
<div id="Top-Common Command-Line Options"><h2 id="Common Command-Line Options" class="header"><a href="#Top-Common Command-Line Options">Common Command-Line Options</a></h2></div>

<p>
Depending on the version (especially between Linux’s procps-ng and other UNIX/BSD versions), the available options may differ slightly. Here are some widely used ones:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>-b</code> (Batch Mode): Run <code>top</code> in non-interactive mode. This is useful for scripting or logging the output because the information is printed to standard output instead of being displayed interactively.
<pre bash>
top -b
</pre>

<li>
<code>-n [number]</code> (Number of Iterations): Used with -b, it specifies how many iterations (refresh cycles) top should produce before exiting.
<pre bash>
top -b -n 3
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
This will print three snapshots of the system’s statistics.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-d [seconds]</code> (Delay Between Updates): Sets the delay time in seconds between each screen update. For example:
<pre bash>
top -d 2
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
...updates every two seconds.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-u [username]</code> (User Filter): Displays only the processes of the specified user.
<pre bash>
top -u alice
</pre>

<li>
<code>-p [pid list]</code> (Monitor Specific PIDs): Allows you to monitor only specific processes by providing a comma-separated list of process IDs.
<pre bash>
top -p 1234,5678
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
Other options and interactive commands may be available depending on your system’s implementation of top. You can usually access the manual page with:
</p>

<pre bash>
man top
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Quick Check of System Load"></span><strong id="Quick Check of System Load">Quick Check of System Load</strong>: Simply running <code>top</code> gives you an at-a-glance look at how busy your system is, which processes are consuming the most CPU, and how your memory is being used.

<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Troubleshooting Performance Issues"></span><strong id="Troubleshooting Performance Issues">Troubleshooting Performance Issues</strong>: If your system is slow or unresponsive, you can use <code>top</code> to identify any runaway processes or applications hogging resources.

<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Logging or Automated Monitoring"></span><strong id="Logging or Automated Monitoring">Logging or Automated Monitoring</strong>: When combined with the <code>-b</code> and <code>-n</code> options, <code>top</code> can be scheduled (via cron jobs, for example) to log system performance over time.

<li>
<span id="Top-Practical Usage Scenarios-Interactive Process Management"></span><strong id="Interactive Process Management">Interactive Process Management</strong>: You can renice processes to adjust their scheduling priority, or kill processes directly from the top interface, which is especially helpful for administrators managing system load.

</ul>
<p>
The <code>top</code> command is a fundamental tool for system monitoring and process management, and its real-time, interactive capabilities make it invaluable for both everyday use and troubleshooting. Experimenting with its interactive commands and options can give you deeper insights into system performance on your machine.

<div id="Overview of macOS Top"><h1 id="Overview of macOS Top" class="header"><a href="#Overview of macOS Top">Overview of macOS Top</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Overview of macOS Top-Purpose"></span><strong id="Purpose">Purpose</strong>: macOS’s top provides a real‑time snapshot of system activity and resource usage. It shows overall system statistics (like load averages, CPU usage, and memory usage) in a header, followed by a table listing all running processes along with several metrics. However, unlike some Linux tools, the macOS version (a BSD version) isn’t as richly interactive; it’s more about displaying current statuses rather than letting you dynamically reorder or filter data on the fly.

</ul>
<div id="Overview of macOS Top-Key Components of the Display"><h2 id="Key Components of the Display" class="header"><a href="#Overview of macOS Top-Key Components of the Display">Key Components of the Display</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Overview of macOS Top-Key Components of the Display-Header Section"></span><strong id="Header Section">Header Section</strong>: The top part of the screen typically includes:

<p>
Since macOS top isn’t as interactive as its Linux cousin, you often mold its output using command-line options:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Overview of macOS Top-Command-Line Options &amp; How to Use Them-Snapshot Mode ('-l')"></span><strong id="Snapshot Mode ('-l')">Snapshot Mode ('-l')</strong>: By default, macOS top runs continuously. The -l option (short for “levels” or “samples”) tells top to take a fixed number of snapshots and then exit. For example:
<pre bash>
top -l 1
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
...prints one iteration of output and quits. This is especially useful if you want to capture the information for scripting or logging.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Overview of macOS Top-Command-Line Options &amp; How to Use Them-Sorting Order ('-o')"></span><strong id="Sorting Order ('-o')">Sorting Order ('-o')</strong>: You can specify which column to sort by. For instance, to sort by CPU usage, you can use:
<pre bash>
top -o cpu
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
(Other keys like <code>mem</code> for memory usage can also be used.) This changes how the process table is ordered.
Refresh Delay (-s): Although macOS top refreshes at a default interval (often every second or two), you can adjust the delay between updates using the <code>-s</code> option:
</p>

<pre bash>
top -s 2
</pre>

<p>
This sets a 2‑second delay between refreshes.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Overview of macOS Top-Command-Line Options &amp; How to Use Them-Filtering by User"></span><strong id="Filtering by User">Filtering by User</strong>: While not as common as in Linux top, some versions of macOS top allow you to filter by a specific user—for example,
<pre bash>
top -U &lt;username&gt;
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
(check your man top on your macOS version as availability of options may vary).
</p>

<div id="Overview of macOS Top-Using macOS top Effectively"><h2 id="Using macOS top Effectively" class="header"><a href="#Overview of macOS Top-Using macOS top Effectively">Using macOS top Effectively</a></h2></div>

<p>
Because the macOS version is less interactive than Linux’s, here are a few tips:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Overview of macOS Top-Using macOS top Effectively-Get a Quick Snapshot"></span><strong id="Get a Quick Snapshot">Get a Quick Snapshot</strong>: If you’re just staring at a continually updating page, try using:
<pre bash>
top -l 1
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
This prints one set of data and then exits, so you can study it without the distraction of constant updates.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Overview of macOS Top-Using macOS top Effectively-Sort for What You Need"></span><strong id="Sort for What You Need">Sort for What You Need</strong>: If you're interested in which processes are using the most CPU, sort with:
<pre bash>
top -o cpu
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
Or, if memory is your focus:
</p>

<pre bash>
top -o mem
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Overview of macOS Top-Using macOS top Effectively-Customize the Columns"></span><strong id="Customize the Columns">Customize the Columns</strong>: Some macOS versions of top allow you to specify which statistics are shown via a <code>-stats</code> option. For example, you might use something like:
<pre bash>
top -stats pid,command,cpu,mem
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
(The exact syntax can vary between macOS releases—consult <code>man top</code> for your version.)
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Overview of macOS Top-Using macOS top Effectively-Graphical Alternatives"></span><strong id="Graphical Alternatives">Graphical Alternatives</strong>: If you find the text-based interface overwhelming, consider using the built-in Activity Monitor. It provides similar information with a graphical interface and more easily clickable controls for sorting and filtering.

</ul>
<div id="Overview of macOS Top-Customize the Output with -stats"><h2 id="Customize the Output with -stats" class="header"><a href="#Overview of macOS Top-Customize the Output with -stats">Customize the Output with -stats</a></h2></div>

<p>
macOS’s top lets you specify which columns (statistics) you want to display. By reducing the number of columns, you can focus on what's important for your analysis. For example, to display only the process ID, command, CPU, and memory usage, you can use:
</p>
<pre bash>
top -l 1 -stats pid,command,cpu,mem
</pre>
<p>
This command limits the output to a few key columns, making it much easier to read.
</p>

<div id="Overview of macOS Top-Sort the Output"><h2 id="Sort the Output" class="header"><a href="#Overview of macOS Top-Sort the Output">Sort the Output</a></h2></div>

<p>
You might want to see the most CPU-intensive processes first. Use the -o option to sort by a particular column. For instance:
</p>

<pre bash>
top -l 1 -o cpu
</pre>
<p>
This sorts the process list by CPU usage. You can change it to mem or another available column if that’s more relevant to your needs.
</p>

<div id="Overview of macOS Top-Redirect or Pipe the Output"><h2 id="Redirect or Pipe the Output" class="header"><a href="#Overview of macOS Top-Redirect or Pipe the Output">Redirect or Pipe the Output</a></h2></div>

<p>
If the output is still too long for your screen or terminal window, you can redirect or pipe it to tools like less for easier navigation:
Pipe to less:
</p>

<pre bash>
top -l 1 | less
</pre>

<p>
This way, you can scroll through the output at your leisure and search within it.
</p>

<div id="Overview of macOS Top-Redirect to a File:"><h2 id="Redirect to a File:" class="header"><a href="#Overview of macOS Top-Redirect to a File:">Redirect to a File:</a></h2></div>

<pre bash>
top -l 1 &gt; top_output.txt
</pre>
<p>
Then open the file using your preferred text editor where you can analyze it in a more controlled environment.
</p>

<div id="Overview of macOS Top-Use Scripting or Filtering Tools"><h2 id="Use Scripting or Filtering Tools" class="header"><a href="#Overview of macOS Top-Use Scripting or Filtering Tools">Use Scripting or Filtering Tools</a></h2></div>

<p>
If you're looking for specific information within the output, you might combine it with grep or awk to extract the data you need. For example, if you’re interested in any lines that include a process using more than, say, 20% CPU, you could do something like:
</p>

<pre bash>
top -l 1 -o cpu | grep ' 2[0-9]\| [3-9][0-9]'
</pre>
<p>
(Note: This is a rough example using regex to search for numbers starting with 20–99. You might adjust the pattern depending on your top output format.)

<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?"><h1 id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?">What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?</a></h1></div>

<p>
Both Linux and macOS ship with a <code>top</code> utility, but they’re built on different codebases and reflect differences in the underlying systems. Here’s a breakdown of the major differences you might encounter:
</p>

<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Origins and Implementation"><h2 id="Origins and Implementation" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Origins and Implementation">Origins and Implementation</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Origins and Implementation-Linux"></span><strong id="Linux">Linux</strong>: Linux typically uses the <code>top</code> command from the procps (or procps-ng) package. It gets its information in real time from the <code>/proc</code> filesystem, which offers detailed process and system statistics.

<li>
<span id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Origins and Implementation-macOS"></span><strong id="macOS">macOS</strong>: macOS uses a BSD variant of <code>top</code>. It pulls information from its own kernel interfaces and uses a different default layout and set of statistics that reflect BSD traditions.

</ul>
<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Display and Layout"><h2 id="Display and Layout" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Display and Layout">Display and Layout</a></h2></div>

<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Display and Layout-Linux Top:"><h3 id="Linux Top:" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Display and Layout-Linux Top:">Linux Top:</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
The header area usually shows load averages, task counts, CPU usage (divided into user, system, nice, idle, etc.), memory usage, and swap statistics.

<li>
The process list often includes columns such as PID, USER, PR (priority), NI (nice value), VIRT, RES (resident memory), SHR (shared memory), S (status), %CPU, %MEM, and COMMAND.

<li>
Many versions support configurable refresh rates, colored output, and different views via interactive commands.

</ul>
<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Display and Layout-macOS Top:"><h3 id="macOS Top:" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Display and Layout-macOS Top:">macOS Top:</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
The output layout is quite different. The header typically shows system load, uptime, and a summary of processes, but the specific columns and their order differ.

<li>
macOS might display columns labeled with slightly different headings (for example, CPU usage might be shown with different percentages and the memory details might be summarized more concisely).

<li>
The overall look and organization reflect BSD-style reporting, which many users describe as “simpler” or at least distinct from the Linux version.

</ul>
<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Command-Line Options"><h2 id="Command-Line Options" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Command-Line Options">Command-Line Options</a></h2></div>

<p>
The available options and their syntax differ considerably between the two:
</p>

<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Command-Line Options-Linux Top Options (procps-ng):"><h3 id="Linux Top Options (procps-ng):" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Command-Line Options-Linux Top Options (procps-ng):">Linux Top Options (procps-ng):</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-b</code>: Batch mode—suitable for logging or non-interactive use.

<li>
<code>-n [number]</code>: Specifies the number of iterations in batch mode.

<li>
<code>-d [seconds]</code>: Sets the delay between updates.

<li>
<code>-p [pid list]</code>: Monitor specific process IDs.

<li>
Interactive commands such as P for CPU sort and M for memory sort are common.

</ul>
<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Command-Line Options-macOS Top Options (BSD Top):"><h3 id="macOS Top Options (BSD Top):" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Command-Line Options-macOS Top Options (BSD Top):">macOS Top Options (BSD Top):</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-l [number]</code>: Instead of <code>-n</code>, macOS’s top uses <code>-l</code> to specify the number of samples (snapshots). For example, <code>top -l 1</code> takes a single snapshot rather than entering the continuous, interactive mode.

<li>
Other command-line flags differ in name and effect. Some options available in Linux top (like batch mode with <code>-b</code>) do not exist or work differently in the macOS version.

<li>
The interactive commands might also differ: macOS top generally provides a help screen (<code>?</code> or <code>h</code>), but many of the sorting or filtering hotkeys aren’t identical to Linux’s top.

</ul>
<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Performance Metrics and Calculation"><h2 id="Performance Metrics and Calculation" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Performance Metrics and Calculation">Performance Metrics and Calculation</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Performance Metrics and Calculation-Data Sources"></span><strong id="Data Sources">Data Sources</strong>: Linux’s <code>/proc</code> provides very detailed insight into every aspect of a running process and system resource, whereas macOS relies on different kernel statistics. This can result in slight differences in how CPU, memory, or I/O usage is computed and displayed.

<li>
<span id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Performance Metrics and Calculation-Default Refresh Rates"></span><strong id="Default Refresh Rates">Default Refresh Rates</strong>: The two versions may have different default refresh intervals or methods of summarizing transient spikes.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Offers a host of interactive commands to change sorting, filtering, and even to customize the display on the fly.

<li>
Many Linux distributions include a version with extensive configuration capabilities, such as saving your session layout for later use.

</ul>
<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Customization and Interactivity-macOS Top:"><h3 id="macOS Top:" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Customization and Interactivity-macOS Top:">macOS Top:</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
While interactive, its customization options are generally less extensive compared to Linux’s procps-ng top.

<li>
You might have to rely more on command-line options (like <code>-l</code>) to get the output format you need rather than interactive tweaks.

</ul>
<div id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Summary"><h2 id="Summary" class="header"><a href="#What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Summary">Summary</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Summary-Implementation"></span><strong id="Implementation">Implementation</strong>: Linux <code>top</code> (usually procps-ng) reads detailed statistics from <code>/proc</code>, while macOS top is built as part of the BSD heritage with its own kernel interfaces.

<li>
<span id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Summary-Display"></span><strong id="Display">Display</strong>: The layout, column names, and overall appearance differ, with Linux top generally being more detailed and customizable.

<li>
<span id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Summary-Options"></span><strong id="Options">Options</strong>: Command-line options differ—Linux top offers flags like <code>-b</code>, <code>-n</code>, and <code>-d</code>, whereas macOS top uses <code>-l</code> for sample counts and has a different set of command-line switches.

<li>
<span id="What differences might there be between Linux and MacOS?-Summary-Interactivity"></span><strong id="Interactivity">Interactivity</strong>: Both are interactive utilities, but the available hotkeys and customization features reflect their different origins and design philosophies.

</ul>
<p>
Understanding these differences can help you better interpret the output on each system and choose the right tool or options for your needs. If you ever need more details, checking the manual pages (<code>man top</code>) on each platform will give you the most accurate, system-specific information.

<div id="What is meant by 'renice'?"><h1 id="What is meant by 'renice'?" class="header"><a href="#What is meant by 'renice'?">What is meant by 'renice'?</a></h1></div>

<p>
The term "renice" refers to the process of changing the "nice value" (priority) of a running process in Unix-like operating systems.
</p>

<div id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?"><h3 id="What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?" class="header"><a href="#What is meant by 'renice'?-What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?">What Is the "Nice" Value?</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?-Nice value"></span><strong id="Nice value">Nice value</strong>: Every process has a numerical niceness value that influences its scheduling priority. The value ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). A lower nice value means the process is considered less "nice" to its peers (i.e., it gets more CPU time), while a higher value means it’s more "nice" (i.e., it yields CPU time to other processes).

<li>
<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Is the &quot;Nice&quot; Value?-Default Behavior"></span><strong id="Default Behavior">Default Behavior</strong>: When a process starts, it receives a default nice value (usually 0). Regular users can typically only increase (make "nicer") this value, meaning they can lower the process's priority. To lower a process's nice value (i.e., raise its priority), root or an administrator’s privileges are usually required.

</ul>

<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Does &quot;Renice&quot; Do?-Renice Operation"></span><strong id="Renice Operation">Renice Operation</strong>: The renice command allows you to change the nice value of a process (or multiple processes) that is already running. This is useful for adjusting system performance or priorities on the fly. For example, if a particular process is hogging CPU resources, you might "renice" it to a higher nice value so that it runs with lower priority.

<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-What Does &quot;Renice&quot; Do?-Command Syntax"></span><strong id="Command Syntax">Command Syntax</strong>: A typical usage might look like this:
<pre bash>
renice 10 -p 1234
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
This command changes the nice value of the process with PID 1234 to 10.

<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Reducing Priority of Background Tasks"></span><strong id="Reducing Priority of Background Tasks">Reducing Priority of Background Tasks</strong>: If you’re running a CPU-intensive task in the background (like a large file backup or data processing job), you might increase its nice value so it doesn’t interfere with interactive tasks.

<span id="What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Increasing Priority for Critical Tasks"></span><strong id="Increasing Priority for Critical Tasks">Increasing Priority for Critical Tasks</strong>: Conversely, if a process is critical and you need it to run faster, you could lower its nice value (if you have the necessary privileges) so that the system scheduler gives it more CPU time.

<div id="What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Example"><h4 id="Example" class="header"><a href="#What is meant by 'renice'?-Practical Use Cases-Example">Example</a></h4></div>

<p>
Suppose you have a long-running process with PID 5678 that’s slowing down your system. To make it more "nice" (i.e., reduce its priority), you could run:
</p>

<pre bash>
renice 15 -p 5678
</pre>

<p>
This command tells the scheduler to treat the process with PID 5678 as less urgent, letting other interactive processes get more CPU time.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
"Renice" means adjusting the nice value—i.e., the scheduling priority—of a running process.

<li>
It’s accomplished using the <code>renice</code> command.

<li>
Changing priorities can help manage workloads and ensure critical tasks receive sufficient CPU time.
