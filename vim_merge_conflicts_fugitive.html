<div id="Merge Conflict Resolution with Fugitive-Two Ways of Working"><h2 id="Two Ways of Working" class="header"><a href="#Merge Conflict Resolution with Fugitive-Two Ways of Working">Two Ways of Working</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Working in the middle (Working conflict buffer).

<li>
Working in either of the other windows (Target or Merge, Left or Right)

</ul>
<div id="Merge Conflict Resolution with Fugitive-Two Ways of Working-Working in the Working/Conflict buffer (middle)"><h3 id="Working in the Working/Conflict buffer (middle)" class="header"><a href="#Merge Conflict Resolution with Fugitive-Two Ways of Working-Working in the Working/Conflict buffer (middle)">Working in the Working/Conflict buffer (middle)</a></h3></div>

<p>
This is based on <code>:diffget</code><br>
</p>

<p>
While in the middle buffer, specify which buffer to 'get' the changes from:<br>
<code>:diffget //2</code> &lt;-- Obtain (get) from the Target/HEAD window (left). NOTE: the left buffer is always Taret and //2<br>
<code>:diffget //3</code> &lt;-- Obtain (get) from the Merge window (right). NOTE: the right buffer is always Merge and //3<br>
</p>

<p>
This is based on <code>:diffput</code><br>
</p>

<p>
While in either left or right buffers, 'put' changes, and they will automatically go to the Working (HEAD) copy.<br>
<code>:diffput</code> &lt;-- Puts into the Working Copy by default. (You can specify the file name if necessary.)<br>
<code>dp</code> &lt;-- short version of above (in command mode).&lt;<a href="br.html">br</a>&gt;
