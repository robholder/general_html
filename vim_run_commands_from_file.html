<p>
Simply save the list of command you want to execute frequently to a file. Ideally give it a .vim extension:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
e.g. nbaEdits.vim

</ul>
<p>
In the data file you want to execute the commands against simply issue this command from the VIM command line (I've only tried this via Windows):
</p>

<pre>
:source c:\myVimCommands\nbaEdits.vim

**The above assumes your command file is located in a folder at c:\myVimCommands

# This could be a file with a substitution command or 'delete if' line.
</pre>

<p>
When sourcing a file with multiple vim commands, especially substitutions, you can use the <code>silent!</code> command to suppress error messages. Here's how you can do it:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Using <code>silent!</code>: This command will execute the following command silently, suppressing any error messages. For example, if you have a file with the following substitutions:
<pre vim>
%s/oldterm/newterm/g
%s/anotherterm/differentterm/g

#You can modify it to:

silent! %s/oldterm/newterm/g
silent! %s/anotherterm/differentterm/g
</pre>

<li>
Using execute command: You can also wrap your commands with the <code>execute</code> command to add more control. For example (see below for what controls you have):
<pre vim>
execute "silent! %s/oldterm/newterm/g"
execute "silent! %s/anotherterm/differentterm/g"
</pre>

</ol>
<p>
These methods ensure that your vim script runs smoothly without interruption from error messages when terms aren't found.

<p>
The execute wrapper in vim provides several benefits, especially when you're dealing with more complex commands or need to build commands dynamically.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the key advantages:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Dynamic Command Construction: With execute, you can build commands as strings, allowing you to include variables, conditions, or even loop constructs. This is particularly useful for scripting and automation within vim.
<pre vim>
let pattern = "oldterm"
let replacement = "newterm"
execute "silent! %s/" . pattern . "/" . replacement . "/g"
</pre>

<li>
Error Handling: You can combine execute with <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> to handle errors more gracefully. This is useful when you want to ensure that your script continues running even if a specific command fails.
<pre vim>
try
    execute "silent! %s/oldterm/newterm/g"
catch
    echo "Substitution failed"
endtry
</pre>

<li>
Readability and Maintainability: Using execute can make your scripts more readable by clearly separating the construction of the command from its execution. This can be helpful when maintaining and updating your scripts.

<li>
Combining Commands: You can execute multiple commands in a single execute call, which can simplify your scripts and reduce redundancy.
<pre vim>
execute "silent! %s/oldterm/newterm/g" | execute "silent! %s/anotherterm/differentterm/g"
</pre>

<li>
Scripting Flexibility: The execute command allows for more flexible and powerful scripting within vim. You can programmatically determine what commands to run based on various conditions or inputs.

</ol>
<p>
Overall, the execute wrapper enhances the flexibility, readability, and robustness of your vim scripts. Itâ€™s a powerful tool that can take your scripting to the next level.

<p>
Using variables with the execute command in vim involves some specific syntax rules. Here's a quick rundown:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Combining Strings: Use double quotes (") to enclose the entire command. Within the quotes, you can concatenate strings and variables using dots (.). No spaces are needed around the dots.
<pre vim>
let pattern = "oldterm"
let replacement = "newterm"
execute "%s/" . pattern . "/" . replacement . "/g"
</pre>

<li>
Escaping Quotes: If you need to include quotes within the string, use backslashes (\) to escape them.
<pre vim>
let command = "echo 'Hello, World!'"
execute command  " prints Hello, World! 
</pre>

<li>
Handling Spaces: When concatenating strings with variables, ensure that you manage spaces properly. If you need spaces within the command, include them within the string literals.
<pre vim>
let filetype = "javascript"
execute "set filetype=" . filetype
</pre>

<li>
Combining Multiple Variables: You can concatenate multiple variables and string literals to build complex commands.
<pre vim>
let cmd = "silent!"
let pattern = "error"
execute cmd . " %s/" . pattern . "/fixed/g"
</pre>

</ol>
<p>
These rules help ensure that the execute command interprets and runs your dynamically constructed commands correctly.
