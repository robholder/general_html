<p>
How do I see a tree of undos in Vim? 
</p>

<div id="Undo Tree-The Undo Tree"><h2 id="The Undo Tree" class="header"><a href="#Undo Tree-The Undo Tree">The Undo Tree</a></h2></div>

<p>
Vim has an undo tree, which allows you to navigate through different branches of undo history rather than just a linear undo/redo stack. If your text has disappeared and u (undo) says there are no undos left, you might still be able to recover it using Vim’s undo tree commands.
</p>

<div id="Undo Tree-The Undo Tree-Checking the Undo Tree"><h3 id="Checking the Undo Tree" class="header"><a href="#Undo Tree-The Undo Tree-Checking the Undo Tree">Checking the Undo Tree</a></h3></div>

<p>
List all undo branches Run:
</p>

<pre vim>
:undolist
</pre>

<p>
This will show a list of available undo states, each with a number. You can jump to a specific undo state using:
</p>

<pre vim>
:undo &lt;number&gt;
</pre>
<p>
...where &lt;number&gt; is one of the IDs from :undolist.
</p>

<div id="Undo Tree-The Undo Tree-Navigate through the undo tree"><h3 id="Navigate through the undo tree" class="header"><a href="#Undo Tree-The Undo Tree-Navigate through the undo tree">Navigate through the undo tree</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>g</code>- moves backward through the undo tree (to previous branches).

<li>
<code>g+</code> moves forward through the undo tree (to later branches). These commands allow you to recover text that might have been lost due to branching undo history.

</ul>
<p>
Use time-based undo If you remember when the text was last present, you can go back in time:
</p>

<pre vim>
:earlier 10m
</pre>

<p>
This moves the buffer state 10 minutes earlier. You can also use:
</p>

<pre vim>
:later 5m
</pre>
<p>
...to move forward in time.
</p>

<div id="Undo Tree-The Undo Tree-Persistent Undo (If Enabled)"><h3 id="Persistent Undo (If Enabled)" class="header"><a href="#Undo Tree-The Undo Tree-Persistent Undo (If Enabled)">Persistent Undo (If Enabled)</a></h3></div>

<p>
If you have persistent undo enabled, Vim stores undo history even after closing the file. You can check if it’s enabled with:
</p>

<pre vim>
:set undofile?
</pre>

<p>
If it’s off, you won’t be able to recover undo history after closing Vim.
</p>

<div id="Undo Tree-The Undo Tree-Undo Tree Visualization"><h3 id="Undo Tree Visualization" class="header"><a href="#Undo Tree-The Undo Tree-Undo Tree Visualization">Undo Tree Visualization</a></h3></div>

<p>
If you want a graphical representation of the undo tree, you can use the UndoTree plugin (Undotree), which provides a visual way to navigate undo branches.
