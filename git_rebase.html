<p>
A 'rebase' is an alternative to a regular merge of two branches. It solves an issue where a feature branch has diverged from the main/master branch.
</p>

<p>
Instead of creating a regular merge (from the latest feature commit to the latest main/master commit), it re-builds the feature branch commits by building on the commit of the main/master branch where the two branches diverged.
</p>

<p>
Rebase does this by effectively merging the first commit of the feature branch with the commit on the main/master where they diverge.
</p>

<p>
The result is that the last commit of the feature branch can be fast-forward merged with the main/master branch.
</p>

<p>
However, to do this, Git must re-commit each commit (new commit IDs and all) to adjust the 'base' of the divergence.
</p>

<p>
Effectively, the merge is performed at the start of the divergence instead of at the end of each branch's commit tree.
