<p>
Below is an explanation comparing the two isinstance checks from the example script and why they differ:

<div id="Python - Transform Matrix Script-Copilot's Explanation for Code-Transform Matrix Check"><h3 id="Transform Matrix Check" class="header"><a href="#Python - Transform Matrix Script-Copilot's Explanation for Code-Transform Matrix Check">Transform Matrix Check</a></h3></div>

<p>
In the script, the transform matrix is expected to be a 2×N matrix represented as a tuple of two tuples. The code uses:
</p>
<pre python>
if not (
    isinstance(transform_matrix, tuple) and
    len(transform_matrix) == 2 and
    all(isinstance(row, tuple) for row in transform_matrix)
):
    raise ValueError("Transform matrix must be a tuple of two tuples.")
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<code>isinstance(transform_matrix, tuple)</code> This requires that the outer container is a tuple. The intention here is to enforce immutability and a strict structure.

<li>
<code>len(transform_matrix) == 2</code> Exactly two rows are required, since the transform matrix is defined with two rows (one for producing the new x-coordinate and one for the new y-coordinate).

<li>
<code>all(isinstance(row, tuple)</code> for row in transform_matrix) Each row must be a tuple. This further enforces that the structure and format are exactly what is expected (each row being a tuple of numbers).

</ul>

<p>
Because the transformation matrix is fundamental to the calculation, its shape is strictly defined as two rows. Therefore, we demand a tuple containing exactly two tuples to avoid any ambiguity.
</p>

<div id="Python - Transform Matrix Script-Copilot's Explanation for Code-Points List Check"><h3 id="Points List Check" class="header"><a href="#Python - Transform Matrix Script-Copilot's Explanation for Code-Points List Check">Points List Check</a></h3></div>

<p>
For the input that contains the points, we accept more flexibility. The code uses:
</p>

<pre python>
if not (isinstance(points, (tuple, list)) and all(isinstance(pt, tuple) for pt in points)):
    raise ValueError("Points must be provided as a tuple or list of tuples.")
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<code>isinstance(points, (tuple, list))</code> Here, the points can be contained in either a tuple or a list. This is because while the structure of each individual point is important, the overall container is allowed to be mutable (a list) or immutable (a tuple). Flexibility is useful—users might naturally enter a list of points or a tuple of points.

<li>
<code>all(isinstance(pt, tuple) for pt in points)</code> Each individual point must be a tuple, ensuring that every point is structured correctly as a set of coordinates (e.g., <code>(x, y)</code> or an N-tuple consistent with the transform matrix’s number of columns).

</ul>

<p>
For the points, the number of points is variable and not fixed—so allowing a list (or tuple) gives flexibility. However, the inner representation of each point remains consistent by requiring that each point is a tuple.

<ul>

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Python - Transform Matrix Script-Copilot's Explanation for Code-Summary of the Differences-Container Flexibility:"></span><strong id="Container Flexibility:">Container Flexibility:</strong>

<ul>
<li>
The transform matrix is rigidly enforced as a tuple because its structure is fixed and fundamental to the transformation—two rows only.

<li>
Points are allowed to be either a tuple or a list for convenience since you might have any number of points.

</ul>
<li>
Purpose of Each Check:

<ul>
<li>
The strict check for the transform matrix ensures that the mathematical operation (calculating dot products to get two output coordinates) makes sense.

<li>
The more flexible check for points accommodates natural data entry for multiple coordinates, while still ensuring that each element is a point (tuple).

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
This design helps maintain the robustness of the multiplication operation while allowing user input to be somewhat flexible where it makes sense.

<p>
An adapted version of the code that handles both cases—when the user enters a list of point tuples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>((x1, y1), (x2, y2))</code>

</ul>
<p>
or just a single point tuple:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>(x, y)</code>

</ul>
<p>
In the case of a single point tuple, the script will wrap it in an outer tuple so that further processing can handle it as a collection of one point.
</p>

<div id="Adapted Version with Option for Single Point-Explanation"><h4 id="Explanation" class="header"><a href="#Adapted Version with Option for Single Point-Explanation">Explanation</a></h4></div>

<p>
Input Parsing with <code>ast.literal_eval</code>: Both the transform matrix and the points are parsed safely.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The transform matrix must be a tuple of exactly two inner tuples.

<li>
The points input can be either a tuple/list of point tuples or just a single point tuple.

</ul>

<p>
Single Point Handling: For the points, after obtaining the literal value, the script checks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If it's a tuple and its first element isn’t another tuple, then it assumes the input represents a single point.

<li>
It does a similar check for a list input. Then, it wraps that single point into an outer tuple so that later code can iterate over it as if it were a tuple of points.

</ul>

<p>
Multiplication: The transformation is applied by computing the dot product of each row (from the 2×N transform matrix) with the input point (an N-element tuple). This yields a new 2D coordinate.
</p>

<p>
Output: All transformed points are printed.
</p>

<p>
This adaptation ensures that whether the user types <code>(x, y)</code> or (<code>(x, y), ...</code>), the script will interpret the input correctly and apply the transformation accordingly.
</p>

# Example:
T = |  1  3 |
    | -2  0 |
           
P = | -1 |
    |  2 |
         
./matrix_copilot.py
Enter the transform matrix as a tuple of two tuples (e.g., ((a, b), (c, d))): ((1, 3), (-2, 0))
Enter point(s) as a tuple of tuples (for a single point, enter (x, y)): (-1, 2)

Transformed points:
Point 1: (5, 2)

# Transformed P:
