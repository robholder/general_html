<ul>
<li>
<code>u</code> (Undo): In normal mode, pressing u undoes the last change you made. Each press moves one step back in your change history.

<li>
<code>&lt;ctrl&gt;r</code> (Redo): If you've undone a change, you can press <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;r</code> in normal mode to redo it. This essentially reverses the most recent undo operation.

<ul>

<code>U</code>: This command undoes all changes made to the current line since you moved into normal mode. Note that this is not part of the regular undo tree and is somewhat special in how it only deals with a single line of modifications.

<p>
Vim doesn't simply maintain a linear history—it can create branches if you undo changes and then start editing. This branching can be navigated with a couple of useful commands:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>:undolist</code>: This command displays a list of undo branches and their revision numbers. It helps you see how far back you can go and gives you reference numbers for further navigation.

</ul>
  
<ul>
<li>
<code>:earlier {time or count}</code>: Instead of undoing one change at a time, you can jump backwards by specifying either a time (using suffixes like <code>s</code> for seconds, <code>m</code> for minutes, etc.) or a number of changes.

<ul>
<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
<code>:earlier 10</code> goes back 10 changes.

<li>
<code>:earlier 2m</code> reverts the file to the state it was in 2 minutes ago.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
  
<ul>
<li>
<code>:later {time or count}</code>: Conversely, if you have stepped back using :earlier, this command allows you to move forward (redo) changes in the timeline.

<ul>
<li>
Example:

<ul>
<li>
<code>:later 5</code> re-applies the next 5 changes in the history.

<li>
<code>:later 1m</code> advances to the state from 1 minute later.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
These commands let you move fluidly through the "undo tree" rather than stepping change by change.
</p>

<div id="Undo Commands-Understanding the Undo Tree"><h2 id="Understanding the Undo Tree" class="header"><a href="#Undo Commands-Understanding the Undo Tree">Understanding the Undo Tree</a></h2></div>

<p>
When you make changes, Vim internally builds what’s known as an undo tree. If you undo a change and then start editing, it creates a branch in that tree. While the basic <code>u</code> and <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;r</code> commands traverse along the current branch, using <code>:earlier</code> and <code>:later</code> gives you direct control over navigating through the timeline.
</p>

<p>
Tools like the Undotree plugin can provide a visual representation, making it easier to understand and choose which branch or state to revert to.

<div id="Undo Commands-Final Thoughts"><h2 id="Final Thoughts" class="header"><a href="#Undo Commands-Final Thoughts">Final Thoughts</a></h2></div>

<p>
Vim's undo functionality is more than just a simple "step back" mechanism; it's a robust system that allows you to navigate complex change histories in a flexible way. Whether you're catching a mistake a few keystrokes back with <code>u</code> and <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;r</code> or exploring older versions of your file with <code>:earlier</code> and <code>:later</code>, understanding these commands can significantly enhance your editing efficiency. If you’re curious about visualizing this process, exploring plugins that graphically represent the undo tree might be an engaging next step.
</p>


<div id="Undo Settings"><h1 id="Undo Settings" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings">Undo Settings</a></h1></div>

<p>
A break down of the main undo-related settings in Vim, how they work, and when you might want to adjust them:
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-undofile / noundofile"><h2 id="undofile / noundofile" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undofile / noundofile">undofile / noundofile</a></h2></div>

<p>
<code>set undofile</code>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
What It Does: The <code>undofile</code> option tells Vim to save your undo history to an external file. When enabled (using <code>set undofile</code>), Vim preserves your changes even after you close and reopen a file. In contrast, <code>set noundofile</code> (which is the default) means that undo history is kept only in memory and is lost when the session ends.

<li>
Use Cases:

<ul>
<li>
Enable persistent undo: When you want to be able to undo changes across sessions, turn on <code>undofile</code>.

<li>
Disable persistent undo: If you prefer not saving extra files or if you’re working on a temporary file, you can leave it off (using <code>noundofile</code>).

</ul>
<li>
Implementation Details: Enabling persistent undo makes Vim automatically write an "undo file" in a designated directory (see <code>undodir</code>). When you re-open a file, Vim checks for this file and reloads the undo history, allowing you to step back through your edits as though you never closed the file.

</ul>
<div id="Undo Settings-undodir"><h2 id="undodir" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undodir">undodir</a></h2></div>

<p>
<code>set undodir=./.vim-undo//,~/.vim/undo//</code>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
What It Does: The <code>undodir</code> setting specifies the directory where Vim will store undo files when <code>undofile</code> is enabled.

<li>
Use Cases:

<ul>
<li>
Organization: Keeping your undo files in one dedicated folder (like <code>~/.vim/undo</code>) helps prevent clutter in your working directories.

<li>
Permission Management: You can choose a directory where you have write permissions, which is especially useful in restricted environments.

</ul>
<li>
Implementation Details: You set it with a command like <code>set undodir=~/.vim/undo</code>. Vim then writes the persistent undo information into this folder, typically using a naming scheme based on the file’s full path so that undo files are unique per file.

</ul>
<div id="Undo Settings-undodir-More on the 'undodir'"><h4 id="More on the 'undodir'" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undodir-More on the 'undodir'">More on the 'undodir'</a></h4></div>

<p>
If you  have the <a href="vim_undo.html#Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos">vimrc block</a> as shown later on this page, and run <code>:set undodir?</code> to check the settings for the <code>undodir</code>, the setting is:
</p>
<pre vim>
undodir=./.vim-undo//,~/.vim/undo//
</pre>


<p>
The two paths listed in this <code>undodir</code> setting serve different purposes and provide flexibility for where Vim can store undo files.
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-undodir-What undodir Does"><h4 id="What undodir Does" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undodir-What undodir Does">What undodir Does</a></h4></div>

<p>
The <code>undodir</code> option specifies the directories where Vim will save undo history files when <code>undofile</code> is enabled. These undo files allow Vim to persist undo history even after the file is closed and reopened.
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-undodir-Why Two Paths?"><h4 id="Why Two Paths?" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undodir-Why Two Paths?">Why Two Paths?</a></h4></div>

<p>
LOCAL:
</p>

<pre vim>
./.vim-undo//:
</pre>

<p>
This path is a relative directory, meaning it is specific to the current working directory or the location of the file you're editing.
</p>

<p>
Vim will try to save undo files in this directory first, providing a local storage option for undo history. This is useful when working on different projects because it keeps undo files organized within the project's folder structure.
</p>

<p>
GLOBAL:
</p>

<pre vim>
~/.vim/undo//:
</pre>

<p>
This is an absolute path, pointing to a centralized directory (<code>~/.vim/undo</code>) in your home folder.
</p>

<p>
If the local directory (<code>./.vim-undo</code>) doesn’t exist or isn’t writable, Vim falls back to this directory for saving undo files. This ensures undo history is still saved even when the local path is unavailable.
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-undodir-Benefits of This Setup"><h4 id="Benefits of This Setup" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undodir-Benefits of This Setup">Benefits of This Setup</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Flexibility: Undo files are stored locally whenever possible (<code>./.vim-undo</code>) but default to a global directory (<code>~/.vim/undo</code>) if needed.

<li>
Organization: You can easily separate undo histories for different projects by using local directories.

<li>
Redundancy: Having both paths ensures Vim has a fallback option to save undo files, reducing the risk of losing history.

</ul>
<div id="Undo Settings-undodir-How to Adjust This Behavior"><h4 id="How to Adjust This Behavior" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undodir-How to Adjust This Behavior">How to Adjust This Behavior</a></h4></div>

<p>
You can modify the undodir setting if you prefer a single path or different directories:
</p>
<pre vim>
:set undodir=/path/to/your/preferred/directory//
</pre>

<div id="Undo Settings-undodir-Do I have to conciously make the './.vim-undo' directory?"><h4 id="Do I have to conciously make the './.vim-undo' directory?" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undodir-Do I have to conciously make the './.vim-undo' directory?">Do I have to conciously make the './.vim-undo' directory?</a></h4></div>

<p>
Yes. For Vim to use the relative path (<code>./.vim-undo</code>) specified in <code>undodir</code>, you need to manually create the <code>./.vim-undo</code> directory in the relevant location (typically the working directory or where your file resides). Vim won't automatically create it for you, and if the directory doesn't exist, Vim will default to the second path in <code>undodir</code> (in our case, <code>~/.vim/undo</code>).
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-undodir-Steps to Create the Directory"><h4 id="Steps to Create the Directory" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undodir-Steps to Create the Directory">Steps to Create the Directory</a></h4></div>

<p>
Navigate to the directory where you want to use the relative path.
</p>

<pre bash>
cd /path/to/your/project
</pre>

<p>
Create the .vim-undo directory:
</p>

<pre bash>
mkdir .vim-undo
</pre>

<p>
Verify that the directory exists:
</p>

<pre bash>
ls -a
</pre>

<p>
Once the <code>./.vim-undo</code> directory is in place, Vim will save undo files there when working on files in that directory.
</p>

<p>
This setup is handy for keeping undo files organized on a per-project basis.
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-undodir-Within a Git Repository"><h4 id="Within a Git Repository" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undodir-Within a Git Repository">Within a Git Repository</a></h4></div>

<p>
Having a <code>.vim-undo</code> directory in your Git repositories is a fantastic way to manage undo histories specific to each project.
</p>

<p>
It keeps things organized and ensures that your undo files don't clutter your global directory (<code>~/.vim/undo</code>). Plus, it works seamlessly with version control since the undo files won’t interfere with the actual tracked files unless you explicitly add them.
</p>

<p>
Just remember to include <code>.vim-undo</code> in your <code>.gitignore</code> file to avoid committing the undo files if you don't want them public or published:
</p>

<pre plaintext>
.vim-undo/
</pre>

<p>
This way, you can maintain clean repos while still enjoying the benefits of local undo history.
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-undolevels"><h2 id="undolevels" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undolevels">undolevels</a></h2></div>
 
<p>
<code>set undolevels=1000</code>
</p>
 
<ul>
<li>
What It Does: This setting determines how many changes (or “levels”) of undo Vim will keep in its internal undo tree.

<li>
Use Cases:

<ul>
<li>
Deep Editing Sessions: If you want a long history to backtrack through extensive work, increasing <code>undolevels</code> (e.g., <code>set undolevels=1000</code>) can be very helpful.

<li>
Memory Considerations: For performance or conserving memory, a lower number might be chosen, though the default often suits many users.

</ul>
<li>
Implementation Details: Vim internally records each change as a node in an undo tree. Setting a higher number means that nodes from far back are retained longer, but it may also mean Vim uses more memory during a long editing session.

</ul>
<div id="Undo Settings-undoreload"><h2 id="undoreload" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undoreload">undoreload</a></h2></div>

<p>
<code>set undoreload=10000</code>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
What It Does: The <code>undoreload</code> setting controls how many lines Vim attempts to reload when performing an undo after a buffer reload (for example, if a file is re-read from disk).

<li>
Use Cases:

<ul>
<li>
Large Files: When dealing with very large files, you might want to limit how much of the file is reloaded to keep the undo process efficient.

<li>
Performance Tuning: Adjusting <code>undoreload</code> can improve performance if you notice delays when undoing changes in big files.

</ul>
<li>
Implementation Details: A value like set <code>undoreload=10000</code> tells Vim that when it needs to compute an undo state after a reload, it should only consider a specified number of lines rather than processing the entire file. This can be especially useful when only a segment of the file was changed.

</ul>
<div id="Undo Settings-undoreload-More details"><h4 id="More details" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undoreload-More details">More details</a></h4></div>

<p>
In Vim, undoreload is a lesser-known but significant setting that comes into play when you reload a file from disk (e.g., with the :e or :edit command). It controls how much of the undo history is preserved after reloading the file. Let’s break it down and explore its practical uses:
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-undoreload-What undoreload Does"><h4 id="What undoreload Does" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undoreload-What undoreload Does">What undoreload Does</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
When you reload a file in Vim, the current undo history is generally lost because reloading essentially resets the buffer to match the file's current state on disk.

<li>
The <code>undoreload</code> option specifies how many undo levels (or changes) Vim attempts to keep after reloading the file.

</ul>
<p>
If <code>undoreload</code> is set to 0 (the default), all undo history is discarded during a reload. By increasing the value of <code>undoreload</code>, you can preserve a certain number of changes in the undo-tree even after reloading.
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-undoreload-Practical Use Cases"><h4 id="Practical Use Cases" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undoreload-Practical Use Cases">Practical Use Cases</a></h4></div>

<p>
Here’s when and why you might want to set <code>undoreload</code> to a specific value:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Accidental or Required Reloading:

<ul>
<li>
If you reload a file after making changes but realize you didn't save, the undo-tree could help you recover those changes. Setting a higher value for <code>undoreload</code> ensures you don’t lose your edits.

</ul>
<li>
Reconciling External Changes:

<ul>
<li>
Imagine you're working on a file, and it gets updated by an external process (e.g., a Git merge or another program). Reloading the file will overwrite your buffer, but a properly set <code>undoreload</code> allows you to undo your way back to earlier states.

</ul>
<li>
Preserving History for Complex Edits:

<ul>
<li>
For projects with long editing sessions, setting <code>undoreload</code> to a higher value can save you from losing undo history when synchronizing files with external tools.

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Undo Settings-undoreload-When and Why to Set undoreload"><h4 id="When and Why to Set undoreload" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undoreload-When and Why to Set undoreload">When and Why to Set undoreload</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Default (<code>0</code>): Useful if you want to completely reset the undo-tree whenever a file is reloaded.

<li>
Higher Value (e.g., <code>1000</code>): Best for workflows where file reloading is frequent, and you want to keep a detailed undo history even after refreshing the file.

</ul>
<p>
To change the value of <code>undoreload</code>, you can set it directly in your session or add it to your .vimrc:
</p>

<pre vim>
:set undoreload=1000
</pre>

<div id="Undo Settings-undoreload-Where It Fits with the Undo-Tree"><h4 id="Where It Fits with the Undo-Tree" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-undoreload-Where It Fits with the Undo-Tree">Where It Fits with the Undo-Tree</a></h4></div>

<p>
The <code>undoreload</code> setting works hand-in-hand with the undo-tree by extending the usability of the tree even in situations where you reload the file. Without <code>undoreload</code>, Vim would discard all previous undo branches during a reload, limiting your ability to recover from mistakes.
</p>

<div id="Undo Settings-Undo Commands and the Undo Tree"><h2 id="Undo Commands and the Undo Tree" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-Undo Commands and the Undo Tree">Undo Commands and the Undo Tree</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Basic Commands:

<ul>
<li>
<code>u</code> --&gt; Undo the last change.

<li>
<code>&lt;ctrl&gt;r</code> --&gt; Redo an undone change.

</ul>
<li>
Advanced Navigation Commands:

<li>
<code>:earlier {time or count}</code> --&gt; Roll back to a specific time or number of changes in the past.

<li>
<code>:later {time or count}</code> --&gt; Move forward again toward the most recent changes.

<li>
Viewing the Undo Tree:

<ul>
<li>
<code>:undolist</code> --&gt; This command shows you a list of undo branches and revisions if you’re curious about the full history structure.

</ul>
<li>
Implementation Details: Vim maintains an internal undo tree that can branch when you undo changes and then start editing again. This tree structure means there might be multiple “paths” of changes you can traverse. Plugins (such as a visual undotree) can help visualize this branching structure, making it easier to navigate complex histories.

<div id="Undo Settings-Additional Thoughts"><h2 id="Additional Thoughts" class="header"><a href="#Undo Settings-Additional Thoughts">Additional Thoughts</a></h2></div>

<p>
Vim's undo system is one of its most powerful features, particularly when you enable persistent undo with <code>undofile</code> and configure a dedicated <code>undodir</code>. For users who spend hours editing files, having a deep undo history with a high <code>undolevels</code> value can be a lifesaver. On the other hand, tweaking <code>undoreload</code> can alleviate performance issues with very large files. If you’re looking to deepen your mastery of Vim, exploring the branching nature of the undo tree (for example, via plugins like Undotree) can provide not just a tool for recovery but also insight into your editing patterns.
</p>


<div id="Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos"><h1 id="Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos" class="header"><a href="#Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos">Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos</a></h1></div>

<p>
The principles of this setting is <a href="vim_undo.html#undodir">here</a>
</p>

<p>
Whole block:
</p>
<pre vim>

</pre>

<p>
Let's break down what each part of your Vim configuration block does:
</p>

<div id="Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos-Checking for Persistent Undo Support"><h4 id="Checking for Persistent Undo Support" class="header"><a href="#Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos-Checking for Persistent Undo Support">Checking for Persistent Undo Support</a></h4></div>

<pre vim>
if exists("+undofile")
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Purpose: This line checks if the <code>undofile</code> option is available in your current version of Vim.

<li>
Explanation: Persistent undo (enabled via <code>undofile</code>) was introduced in Vim 7.3. If Vim supports it (i.e., if <code>+undofile</code> exists), Vim will execute the code inside the block. This way, if you're running an older version, Vim won't try to use a feature that doesn't exist.

</ul>
<div id="Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos-Comments Explaining Persistent Undo"><h4 id="Comments Explaining Persistent Undo" class="header"><a href="#Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos-Comments Explaining Persistent Undo">Comments Explaining Persistent Undo</a></h4></div>

<pre vim>
  " undofile - This allows you to use undos after exiting and restarting
  " This, like swap and backup files, uses .vim-undo first, then ~/.vim/undo
  " :help undo-persistence
  " This is only present in 7.3+
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Purpose: The comments remind you (or anyone reading your vimrc) that:

<ul>
<li>
Enabling <code>undofile</code> allows Vim to store undo history persistently, so you can undo changes even after closing and reopening a file.

<li>
Vim will check for an undo file first in a local directory (e.g., <code>.vim-undo</code>) before looking in a global directory (e.g., <code>~/.vim/undo</code>).

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos-Ensuring the Global Undo Directory Exists"><h4 id="Ensuring the Global Undo Directory Exists" class="header"><a href="#Vimrc Block to Set Permanent Undos-Ensuring the Global Undo Directory Exists">Ensuring the Global Undo Directory Exists</a></h4></div>

<pre vim>
  if isdirectory($HOME . '/.vim/undo') == 0
    :silent !mkdir -p ~/.vim/undo &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
  endif
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Purpose: This section checks if the directory <code>~/.vim/undo</code> exists.

<li>
Step-by-Step Explanation:

<ul>
<li>
<code>isdirectory(\(HOME . '/.vim/undo') == 0</code>: Uses the <code>isdirectory()</code> function to see if the directory exists. The <code>\)HOME</code> environment variable is concatenated with <code>/.vim/undo</code> to form the full path.

<li>
<code>:silent !mkdir -p ~/.vim/undo &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code>: If the directory does not exist (i.e., <code>isdirectory()</code> returns 0), this command silently runs the shell command <code>mkdir -p ~/.vim/undo</code> to create it.

<li>
<code>:silent</code>: Prevents any messages from being displayed.

<li>
<code>&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code>: Redirects both standard output and error messages to <code>/dev/null</code>, so nothing is printed to your screen.

</ul>

<code>set undodir=./.vim-undo//</code>: Sets the first directory in the undo directory list to a folder named <code>.vim-undo</code> located in the current working directory (relative to the file you're editing). The trailing <code>//</code> is special Vim syntax that tells Vim to maintain a directory structure reflecting the original file's full path, which helps avoid filename collisions.

<li>
<code>set undodir+=~/.vim/undo//</code>: Adds another directory (<code>~/.vim/undo//</code>) to the undo directory list. The <code>+=</code> operator appends this path so that Vim will check this location as well.

</ul>
<li>
Use Case: This arrangement lets you keep local undo files (perhaps project-specific) and also have a global backup for persistent undo if the local directory isn't available.

</ul>

<pre vim>
  set undofile
endif
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Purpose: Activates persistent undo in Vim.

<li>
Effect: With <code>undofile</code> enabled, Vim saves your undo history to the directories specified in <code>undodir</code>. This means that even if you close Vim or your system crashes, you can reopen the file later and still have access to your previous undo states.

<p>
This block is a well-rounded configuration that ensures:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Compatibility: It only activates these settings if Vim supports persistent undo.

<li>
Organization: It keeps undo files separated into a project-specific directory and a more global one.

<li>
Robustness: It silently handles the creation of necessary directories without cluttering your output.
