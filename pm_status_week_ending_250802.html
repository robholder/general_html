Good morning!
I'm hoping to be able to update the regular show env with two updates:
A new version of painterly_pmnt.nk (group), and to add a new tool, noisepin_pmnt.nk. I've tried them in my s holderr0609 tooltest area in attach beta, and Sarah Dunton has been using these on her latest (non beta) shots.
The updates are currently sitting here:
/shows/avoa/prod/holderr0609/tooltest/data/nuke/groups/painterly_pmnt.nk
and
/shows/avoa/prod/holderr0609/tooltest/data/nuke/groups/noisepin_pmnt.nk

<p>
Looked at apMatte to see how it works in practice.

Greetings, Terry, Rob and Ian!  As you may have guessed you're joining us on sequence 2230, which is being animated by our pals at Studio Mir.  Yay!!
Terry and Rob, I'm going to try to get you your first shot asap.  Ian, I've got your shot picked out but it's lower priority for you since you've got FB shots still on your plate.
Please watch this video before you start on your shots:
/shows/avoa/documentation/comp/Comp_Launch_Recordings/Korea_Launches/2230/20250723_sq2230_comp_launch_recording.mp4
We're all going to get together at 4:00 so I can do a quick tech launch on what we're getting in in our precomps.  Then we'll do individual launches on your new shots.  Bekah and Rupali you can bail for that part if you like.
Please familiarize yourselves with the keys:
