Hi, Rob!  So, we have 3400/120 and 3400/40 (your next shot) on the targets list for the week.  These are both pretty big shots.  Not knowing where you are with 120, I don't know how reasonable that is as a goal.  Let me know what you think. (edited) 

Thanks!

3400/40 is a new one right? I don't think I saw that on my plate yet.
I can take a look and see how they go.

3400_0040 v08
Added extra bloom at top of floating rocks (left &amp;  right)
Blended the shaved head rim area with the ref art and the transition (first two poses)
Got the open hands closer to the key (cooler and darker)
Boosted red of Sokka's tongue.

Sokka's head is worlds better, and his hands look good.  And yay red tongue! (edited) 
I totally misguided you on the bg rocks.  I talked about the orange bloom that was in the painting.  And the extra bloom is good.  But we also need an orange lift (or orange atmo depending on your terminology) overall on those rocks to bring up all the darks.  It's just an add to push them back.  Jake hates darks or even low mids in his bgs.
(Obviously we don't want orange atmo on the blue rocks.)
Thanks, Rob!
