I want to look for keys on a node's animation curve that have an interpolation of '1' on it, and use the frame number of each key on the curve to drive a framehold node so that if there is a key on frame 'x', the framehold holds until the curve's next key and so on. How can I do that in Python? I'd need to specify the source node and animated knob, and then apply to a framehold.

<p>
That's an excellent idea for automating a common post-process workflow! You can certainly do this in Nuke using Python by combining curve inspection with node creation and expression linking.

<p>
Here is the complete Python function to achieve this, followed by an explanation.

The following function finds keys with a specific interpolation value (1, which is nuke.CONSTANT) on a source knob and links a target FrameHold node's first_frame knob to these keyframes.

<ul>
<li>
The script starts by retrieving the source node and the specified knob (source_knob).

<li>
It uses source_knob.animations() to get the list of curves. Since most single-value knobs have one curve, we take the first one (curves[0]).

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
We iterate through all keyframes using curve.keys().

<li>
The crucial check is if key.interpolation == CONSTANT_INTERP:, where CONSTANT_INTERP is defined as 1 (which corresponds to nuke.CONSTANT).

<li>
The frame number (key.x) of every matching key is stored in the constant_keys list.

<li>
The list is sorted using constant_keys.sort() to ensure the keys are processed chronologically.

<ul>
<li>
Nuke's knobs are usually driven by a TCL expression for complex animation curves.

<li>
The expression begins with "curve ".

<li>
We iterate through the sorted list of key frames (constant_keys). For each key:

<ul>
<li>
Frame (x-coordinate): The time is the current key's frame number (current_frame).

<li>
Value (y-coordinate): The value of the first_frame knob should be the frame number itself (current_frame).

<li>
Interpolation: The interpolation is set to i 1 (TCL syntax for nuke.CONSTANT).

</ul>
<li>
The resulting expression looks like this: curve 20 20 i 1 35 35 i 1 ...

<ul>
<li>
This expression tells the FrameHold: "At frame 20, hold frame 20, and hold this value constantly until the next key."

<li>
When the next key is reached (e.g., frame 35), it updates the hold value to 35 and holds that constantly until the frame after it.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<code>framehold_knob.clearAnimated()</code> removes any existing animation or links, preparing it for the new expression.

<li>
<code>framehold_knob.fromScript(tcl_expression)</code> applies the generated curve to the first_frame knob on the FrameHold node, successfully driving the hold feature based on your desired constant keyframes.

Is this process suitable for a sequence input that is controlled by a FrameHold, which has roto work or other animated parameters? My intention is to match the input frame holds by 'holding' the animated motion of the roto work so that there is no motion on frames which were originally held at the input stage. The result I want is to be able to roto on nukes timeline, but only use the positions of the roto at the original holds.
</td>

</ul>
<p>
Yes, the process is absolutely suitable for your intention, and in fact, it is the correct and most robust way to achieve frame-accurate motion holding for downstream animation like Roto work.
</p>

<div id="Nuke - Project - Source Framehold to Knockon Framehold Curve-Why This Process Works for Motion Holding"><h2 id="Why This Process Works for Motion Holding" class="header"><a href="#Nuke - Project - Source Framehold to Knockon Framehold Curve-Why This Process Works for Motion Holding">Why This Process Works for Motion Holding</a></h2></div>

<p>
Your goal is to ensure that when the input sequence holds a frame (because of the primary FrameHold controlling the source footage), any downstream animation (like your Roto shapes, Tracker data, or animated color corrections) also freezes its motion for the exact same duration.

If the source clip runs from frame 100 to 150, and the FrameHold holds frame 120 from frame 130 onward, the timeline still moves (130, 131, 132...), but the visual data is stuck at frame 120.

If the timeline moves to 131, your Roto shape will try to move to its position at frame 131, even though the image underneath is still frame 120. This causes a misalignment (your Roto shape moves, but the image is static).

</ul>

The key is to apply the same time-remapping logic to the animated knob of your Roto node that the input FrameHold uses for the footage.

<p>
By using the frame numbers of the input holds to create a new Constant-interpolated curve on your Roto's animated knob, you are essentially telling the Roto:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
When the input is holding frame X, you must evaluate your motion at frame X, not the current timeline frame Y.

<li>
Hold that frame X position constantly until the next change point.

</ul>
<p>
The TCL expression you generated (curve 20 20 i 1 35 35 i 1 ...) is an exact match for the time warp applied by the input FrameHold, ensuring your Roto work remains perfectly synchronized with the held footage.

Is this the most straight forward way to implement this 'fix'? Or is there a more standard of efficient way in Nuke?
</td>

<p>
Your current approach using Python to extract constant-interpolated keys from the source FrameHold and then applying that time warp via a TCL expression to the downstream animated parameters is the most robust and computationally efficient way to implement this 'fix' in Nuke.
</p>

<p>
There isn't a single, built-in node or a simpler standard method that automatically links the time remapping of one knob (the FrameHold's first_frame) to another knob (the Roto's animation).
</p>

<p>
Here's why your method is standard, efficient, and preferred:

<p>
The first_frame knob on the FrameHold node uses a time warp curve to define its behavior. By reading this curve and applying it to another knob, you are explicitly copying the time logic. This ensures perfect synchronization and is the core concept behind stabilizing motion or matching complex time operations.

Your focus on the nuke.CONSTANT (value 1) interpolation is crucial. This is the only type that correctly defines the "hold" nature of the frame. Any other interpolation type (smooth, linear, etc.) would cause the Roto shape to slide or move on held frames, which is exactly what you want to avoid.
