<div id="ACES-Capturing (Cameras)"><h2 id="Capturing (Cameras)" class="header"><a href="#ACES-Capturing (Cameras)">Capturing (Cameras)</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Currently, cameras can capture more data than can be displayed:

<ul>
<li>
Broader dynamic range

<li>
Wider color gamut

<li>
Most cameras use proprietary encoding

<ul>
<li>
ACES provides a mechanism for reconciling them.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<div id="ACES - All The Eye Can See"><h1 id="ACES - All The Eye Can See" class="header"><a href="#ACES - All The Eye Can See">ACES - All The Eye Can See</a></h1></div>

<p>
Aim of ACES is to encode visual information regardless of hardware limits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Every color the human eye can see

<li>
30 camera stops of light

</ul>
<p>
The color space is called ACES2065-1 ("ACES twenty-sixty-five, dash one").
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Created in 2012

<li>
Created by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

<li>
Adopted by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE)

</ul>
<div id="ACES - All The Eye Can See-IMP"><h3 id="IMP" class="header"><a href="#ACES - All The Eye Can See-IMP">IMP</a></h3></div>

<p>
ACES Archives are stored as an Interoperable Master Package (IMP), regardless of capture or origination.
</p>

<div id="ACES - All The Eye Can See-Transforms"><h3 id="Transforms" class="header"><a href="#ACES - All The Eye Can See-Transforms">Transforms</a></h3></div>

<p>
Digital data is transformed from one digital representation to others through various processes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Video compression:

<ul>
<li>
Reduces bits (for transmission or delivery)

</ul>
<li>
LUT (Lookup Table):

<ul>
<li>
Modifies the colors

</ul>
<li>
ACES:

<ul>
<li>
A family of transforms:

<ul>
<li>
Transfer between color spaces

<li>
Uses a language called 'CTL' (Color Transformation Language)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<div id="ACES - All The Eye Can See-Output Display Transforms"><h3 id="Output Display Transforms" class="header"><a href="#ACES - All The Eye Can See-Output Display Transforms">Output Display Transforms</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Original imagery is first transformed into ACES2065-1 color space.

<ul>
<li>
IDTs (Input Device Transforms)

</ul>
<li>
Distribution imagery is transformed to match display targets:

<ul>
<li>
ODTs (Output Display Transforms)

<li>
These are written for each output device or target.

<li>
Sometimes artistic tweaks are made to compensate for display shortcomings.

</ul>
</ul>

Viewing these on the 'wrong' displays will result in unsatisfying results.
</p>

<div id="Future Distribution"><h1 id="Future Distribution" class="header"><a href="#Future Distribution">Future Distribution</a></h1></div>

<p>
The gamuts and ranges of the capture devices is maintained in ACES, allowing for future developments and improvements.
</p>

<p>
The ACES2065-1 color space ensures storage at maximum fidelity, with all the image data intact.
</p>

<div id="More on Transforms"><h1 id="More on Transforms" class="header"><a href="#More on Transforms">More on Transforms</a></h1></div>

<div id="More on Transforms-Output Transforms (Not ODT)"><h4 id="Output Transforms (Not ODT)" class="header"><a href="#More on Transforms-Output Transforms (Not ODT)">Output Transforms (Not ODT)</a></h4></div>

<p>
The Output Transform (Not to be confused with the ODT transform)consists of three steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
An optional 'Look' transform:

<ul>
<li>
Specific film stock emulation.

<li>
Bleach-bypass look.

<li>
These 'Look' transforms are applied across the image (no power window edits).

</ul>
<li>
RRT (the Reference Rendering Transform)

<ul>
<li>
Transform the image for a theoretical 'ideal' device:

<li>
Huge dynamic range.

<li>
Color space as vast as that of ACES2065-1.

<li>
This stores the image data in the 'master' form.

</ul>
<li>
ODT (the Output Display Transform):

<ul>
<li>
Specific color space and dynamic range.

<li>
Tailored to the output device or target device.

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="More on Transforms-Monitoring"><h2 id="Monitoring" class="header"><a href="#More on Transforms-Monitoring">Monitoring</a></h2></div>

<p>
The first interaction with ACES is in production; monitors, screens and displays.
</p>

<p>
ACES is the attempt to bring all these devices into a single common color space, and prepare the data for each output device and monitor.
</p>

<div id="More on Transforms-Referencing the Real Scene"><h2 id="Referencing the Real Scene" class="header"><a href="#More on Transforms-Referencing the Real Scene">Referencing the Real Scene</a></h2></div>

<p>
Much like a light meter approach (used with conventional film), ACES embraces the concept of the <span id="More on Transforms-Referencing the Real Scene-Reference Input Capture Device"></span><strong id="Reference Input Capture Device">Reference Input Capture Device</strong>.
</p>

<p>
This looks at the scene and references the light and color visible to the human eye. This is called <span id="More on Transforms-Referencing the Real Scene-Scene-Referred Color"></span><strong id="Scene-Referred Color">Scene-Referred Color</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Cameras are always a compromise:

<ul>
<li>
ACES specifies how to use the limited capture data and put into the ACES color space.

<li>
CGI can produce more data than a physical camera, and this can be managed with ACES.

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="More on Transforms-Perfect-Vision Monitoring"><h2 id="Perfect-Vision Monitoring" class="header"><a href="#More on Transforms-Perfect-Vision Monitoring">Perfect-Vision Monitoring</a></h2></div>

<p>
Just as there is the concept of a perfect capture device, there is also the concept of the <span id="More on Transforms-Perfect-Vision Monitoring-perfect display"></span><strong id="perfect display">perfect display</strong>.
</p>

<p>
ACES can prepare the data for this mathematical model, and from there enable the preparation of data for real-world display devices.
</p>

<p>
Initial ventures with digital cameras meant DPs could only really tell what the image was like from the on-set monitors.This workflow is referred to as 'Display Referred'.
</p>

<div id="Input Device Transforms (IDTs)"><h1 id="Input Device Transforms (IDTs)" class="header"><a href="#Input Device Transforms (IDTs)">Input Device Transforms (IDTs)</a></h1></div>

<p>
Each camera or input device manufacturer usually test their devices and produce their own IDTs for the particular device.
</p>

<p>
If an IDT doesn't exist, a user can create one:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/">External Link: GitHub - ampas/aces-dev</a>

<li>
User IDTs are sometimes shared:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://acescentral.com/c/resources/idts">External Link: ACES resources</a>

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
This IDT transforms facilitate the capture data to be transformed into the ACES color space.
</p>

<div id="Input Device Transforms (IDTs)-Film Scanners"><h4 id="Film Scanners" class="header"><a href="#Input Device Transforms (IDTs)-Film Scanners">Film Scanners</a></h4></div>

<p>
In 2012, SMPTE standardized a format for scanned film images:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Academy Density eXchage (ADX).

<li>
Integrates well into the ACES-based pipeline.

</ul>
<div id="ACESproxy"><h1 id="ACESproxy" class="header"><a href="#ACESproxy">ACESproxy</a></h1></div>

<p>
The most common signal transport is HD-SDI (or High Definition Serial Digital Interface). This is not capable of transmitting all the data contained in ACES2016-1 color space.
</p>

<div id="ACESproxy-Viewing Camera Images"><h4 id="Viewing Camera Images" class="header"><a href="#ACESproxy-Viewing Camera Images">Viewing Camera Images</a></h4></div>

<p>
The solution is currently ACESproxy, a cut-down subset of the ACES data to display.
</p>

<p>
ACESproxy is for monitoring and viewing only, and never stored.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Takes 16-bit linear from ACES2016-1:

<ul>
<li>
Converts to log-encoded video stream.

<li>
Can be displayed on ACES-capable monitors

<li>
Can be converted to the gamut of conventional monitors.

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="The Look Transform"><h1 id="The Look Transform" class="header"><a href="#The Look Transform">The Look Transform</a></h1></div>

<p>
On set, a specific look might be applied by on-set technicians, to allow the DP and Director to 'see' a 'look'.
</p>

<p>
This is stored as and ACES 'Look Transform', and communicated to the colorist later in production.
</p>

<p>
The pristine data is preserved, and the 'look' can be manipulated further if desired with no detrimental effect on the captured data (it's not 'baked').
</p>

<div id="The Look Transform-Dailies"><h2 id="Dailies" class="header"><a href="#The Look Transform-Dailies">Dailies</a></h2></div>

<p>
Viewing of footage in a Dailies scenario, would require an ODT to the target monitors (which may be Rec.709 for HDTV, or tablets.
</p>

<p>
Again, these files would never be part of the stored data or final pipeline.
</p>

<div id="ACESclip"><h1 id="ACESclip" class="header"><a href="#ACESclip">ACESclip</a></h1></div>

<p>
As ACES encoded images move along the stages of a production pipeline, the need to store accumulated meta data:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Metadata

<li>
LUTs

<li>
Notes

<li>
Input Transforms used

<li>
Output Transforms used

<li>
Last Viewed states

</ul>
<p>
These are stored in ACESclip files. These are in XML (eXtensible Markup Language).
</p>

<p>
The ACESclip files flow alongside the ACES image data.
</p>


<div id="VFX"><h1 id="VFX" class="header"><a href="#VFX">VFX</a></h1></div>

<p>
Using CTL (Color Transformation Language) elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
An artist can ingest camera-native or 'capture color space' images and apply an IDT (Input Device Transform)

<li>
Work in an ACES2065-1 configured color space

<li>
Output with an ODT (Output Device Transform)

</ul>
<div id="VFX-Departmental Considerations"><h4 id="Departmental Considerations" class="header"><a href="#VFX-Departmental Considerations">Departmental Considerations</a></h4></div>

<p>
The ACES color space models can be applied to all aspects of CGI color technology, including textures, shaders, objects etc.
</p>

<div id="VFX-ACEScg"><h2 id="ACEScg" class="header"><a href="#VFX-ACEScg">ACEScg</a></h2></div>

<p>
ACEScg is a specialized ACES colorspace, which can be converted to a standard ACES for archiving and future use.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, ACES is based on the same color science used by most CGI tools - the Tristimulus Color Model.
</p>

<p>
The full ACES gamut was found to be unsuitable to the limitations of CGI, which created some wild distortions in the full color space. As a result, the ACEScg color space was introduced. This custom CGI profile still encapsulates and encompases Rec.709 and DCI-P3.
</p>

<div id="DI (Digital Intermediate) and Grading"><h1 id="DI (Digital Intermediate) and Grading" class="header"><a href="#DI (Digital Intermediate) and Grading">DI (Digital Intermediate) and Grading</a></h1></div>

<p>
There are two other ACES variants, aimed at giving a familiar feel to Colorists used to the log and Cineon adjustments they've become used to (via software conventions and 'feel'):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
ACEScc

<li>
ACEScct

</ul>
<p>
While adjustments can be applied in these specialist color spaces, the output is always back to ACES2065-1. This is often automatic or an invisible process.
</p>
