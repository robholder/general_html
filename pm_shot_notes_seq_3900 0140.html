Dale Drummond Notes
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Aang:

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Aang's skin in the fill needs to come down to somewhere between these colors:

<ul>
<li>
See falling Aang key painting

</ul>
<li class="done4">
His cape can be brought down in the fill, too.

</ul>
<li>
FX:

<ul>
<li class="done4">
The bright values in the FX can be brought way down close to the "mid" color.

<ul>
<li>
You could match it to the brightest fx color in the key and be safe.

</ul>
<li class="done4">
I think we can push the stylization on the big FX cloud to break up the 2D lines more.  More high frequency detail will help the scale.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
That's it!  BG looks excellent!

3900 0140
* Aang:
    * Darkened generally
* FX (impact clouds):
    * Reduced light values and colors closer to key
    * Added higher frequency stylization to give scale

Dale Drummond notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="done4">
Can you split the difference on the brightness change on Aang so he reads on those two frames over the dark bg?

<li class="done4">
Break up these smooth 2d lines? (Dark patches between billows)

<ul>
<li>
I dislike those simple hand drawn smooth lines on large scale fx.

3900_0140_comp_v05 – Rob H – First Review
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Pull back the stylization of the impact lines from Aang’s fall.

<li>
Add more atmosphere on the inside the temple building to lift the darks a bit.

<li>
The light from behind can influence the effect and the top of the dust cloud can be a little darker as if it scattering through the volume.

<li>
Simplify the read by making the doorway pinker with atmo.

<li>
Keep the radial smudging on the outside and must faster.

<li>
Turn off the impact poofs.

<li>
As the dust kind of occludes the stairs, the highlights can die down a bit.

</ul>
<p>
Comp to show this shot again.

<ul>
<li>
FX:

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Rein back the FX blurs - showcase the 2d nature

<li class="done4">
Lift values of smoke where the BG is bright (pinks)

<li class="done4">
Lose the little smoke squibs

</ul>
<li>
Tower:

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Lift the darks of the tower like atmo

<li class="done4">
Add brightness to inner thing (like a plate?)

<li class="done4">
Bigger, but faster smudges on the tower from splineblur

</ul>
<li>
Steps:

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Darken highlights on steps as smoke occludes them

</ul>

@Dale Drummond
3900 0140 v08
* FX:
    * Reined back to the 2d cloud fx details
    * Lifted middle section to help suggest brights behind smoke
    * Removed mini squib pufflets
* Tower:
    * Lifted darks of exterior tower a touch
    * Brightened the top area of the inner painting element (where Aang falls for one frame)
    * Broader smudges for radial smears (impact wave)
* Foreground:
    * Shadowed steps and FG as smoke/cloud expands

3900_0140_comp_v09 – Rob H – Second Review
</p>

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Omit the radial effect on the side so it doesn’t feel like it’s going through the wall.

<li class="done4">
Take the value of the craggily cloud bits and bring  them down to make them more related to the grey.

<li class="done4">
Is there room to sell an occlusion shadow on the top of the dust poof? It would get darker the higher it goes.

</ul>
<p>
For prod: Jake would love to do a package of ppuri shots to show them.
</p>

<p>
Comp to take for approval. Approved with notes!

@Dale Drummond
3900 0140 v10
* FX:
    * Added occlusion at top of cloud
    * Darker forms at base of cloud - base occlusion
* Took blasts off tower/edges of tower.

Cool!  Can you do a version where you gain up the brigtness overall on the big FX cloud from 1 on impact to about 1.2 at the end of the shot?  I'm trying to simulate the cloud dissipating and more light refracting through it.  I like the basic structure now.

Good morning, Rob!  I'm sorry I didn't get to this friday night.  I think we made it, anyway.

It looks like overall the shot came down a little.  Could you go back to the brightness level in v10?
For the transparency, I don't think this bright shape really works, shining through the mass of the dust.  If we were to have something like that I think it would be broader and softer.  But at this point in the shot I think it's better just to turn the transparency off.  If you think the 1.2 isn't enough you could boost that a little.
Thanks!
</pre>

<p>
Summary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lift shot back to v10 values

<li>
Remove transparency

</ul>

@Dale Drummond
3900 0140 v12
I took off the transparency, and boosted the area as discussed.
/media/avoa/3900/0140/comp/movies/3900_0140_comp_v12.mov
I'm not seeing a brightness change between v10 and v11 (or this v12) of the shot.
I brought in the exrs and compared with a difference merge, and everything beyond the cloud/gateway looks the same between versions.
