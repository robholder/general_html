Hello there! Good morning.
</p>

<p>
I have created two training shots for you to review so that you can start familiarizing yourself with our 2D process and the Flying Bark template. This is especially relevant now that we will be taking on more of their shots in the coming weeks. We will cover the specifics of the template in the days ahead, but I recommend taking a look at them.
</p>

<p>
The training shots are legacy key shots and do not work with any of our pipeline tools, such as PA_Open, PA_Write, etc., so you'll need to open them directly in Nuke. Please disregard any color space errors. Lastly, don't worry about rendering images; these are very informal shots and are ultimately considered side tasks to help you get started on the show as a whole.

Finally, here are some Confluence pages you should familiarize yourself with. Like the shot template mentioned above, we will go over the content of these pages in more detail, but feel free to get a head start on what's to come. It will be worth bookmarking these pages, as this knowledge base will evolve over time into an information hub.
