<p>
The <code>git diff</code> command is a powerful way to see changes in your working repository that haven't yet been committed. It allows you to review what’s different between commits, the staging area (index), or your working directory, making it an essential tool in your Git workflow. Here are the primary ways to use it:
</p>

<div id="Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area"><h2 id="Compare Working Directory to Staging Area" class="header"><a href="#Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area">Compare Working Directory to Staging Area</a></h2></div>

<p>
Command:
</p>

<pre bash>
git diff
</pre>

<p>
What it does: This shows the differences between your current working directory and the staging area (i.e., what has not yet been added via git add). It highlights which lines have been modified, added, or removed in each file.
</p>

<div id="Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Compare Staging Area to the Last Commit"><h3 id="Compare Staging Area to the Last Commit" class="header"><a href="#Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Compare Staging Area to the Last Commit">Compare Staging Area to the Last Commit</a></h3></div>

<p>
Command:
</p>

<pre bash>
git diff --staged
</pre>
<p>
(or equivalently, <code>git diff --cached</code>)
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Compare Staging Area to the Last Commit-What it does"></span><strong id="What it does">What it does</strong>: Use this to review the changes you have staged and are ready to commit. This is useful for a final check before you run git commit.

</ul>

<div id="Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Compare Two Commits, Branches, or Tags"><h3 id="Compare Two Commits, Branches, or Tags" class="header"><a href="#Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Compare Two Commits, Branches, or Tags">Compare Two Commits, Branches, or Tags</a></h3></div>

<p>
What it does: This form lets you see the differences between two arbitrary points in your repository’s history.
</p>

<p>
Command:
</p>

<pre bash>
git diff &lt;commit1&gt; &lt;commit2&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Using relative pointers for the last two commits:
</p>

<pre bash>
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
</pre>

<p>
or:
</p>

<pre bash>
git diff HEAD^
</pre>

<p>
To get short SHAs (commit ids):
</p>

<pre bash>
git log --oneline -n 2
</pre>
<p>
...this prints the last two commits in short form.
</p>


<p>
You might compare a feature branch with the main branch:
</p>
  
<pre bash>
git diff main feature-branch
</pre>

<p>
This is ideal for code reviews or understanding what changes a branch would introduce if merged.
</p>

<div id="Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Compare a File or Directory"><h3 id="Compare a File or Directory" class="header"><a href="#Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Compare a File or Directory">Compare a File or Directory</a></h3></div>

<p>
Command:
</p>

<pre bash>
git diff -- &lt;file_or_directory&gt;
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Compare a File or Directory-What it does"></span><strong id="What it does">What it does</strong>: By including a path, you can narrow the diff to changes in a particular file or directory. For example:

</ul>
  
<pre bash>
git diff -- path/to/file.txt
</pre>

<p>
This is very handy when you need to inspect changes in a specific part of your project.
</p>

<div id="Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Additional Options"><h3 id="Additional Options" class="header"><a href="#Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Additional Options">Additional Options</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Additional Options-Ignore Whitespace"></span><strong id="Ignore Whitespace">Ignore Whitespace</strong>: Using the -w flag can make the diff ignore changes in whitespace:

</ul>
  
<pre bash>
git diff -w
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Git Diff-Compare Working Directory to Staging Area-Additional Options-Output as a Patch"></span><strong id="Output as a Patch">Output as a Patch</strong>: To save a diff as a patch file (which could be applied later), redirect the output:

</ul>
  
<pre bash>
git diff &gt; changes.patch
</pre>

<div id="Git Diff-How to Read the Output"><h2 id="How to Read the Output" class="header"><a href="#Git Diff-How to Read the Output">How to Read the Output</a></h2></div>

<p>
The diff output uses a unified diff format:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lines starting with a minus (<code>-</code>) represent content that was removed.

<li>
Lines starting with a plus (<code>+</code>) represent content that was added.

<li>
Unchanged context is shown to help you understand where the changes occur.

</ul>

<p>
This granular review is invaluable for ensuring that only the intended changes are being committed, and that you have full insight into what’s been modified.
</p>

<div id="Git Diff-Example Workflow"><h2 id="Example Workflow" class="header"><a href="#Git Diff-Example Workflow">Example Workflow</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Make changes to your files.

<li>
Run <code>git diff</code> to see what’s been modified in your working directory.

<li>
Stage some changes with <code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code>.

<li>
Use <code>git diff --staged</code> to review your staged changes.

<li>
Finally, commit your changes with <code>git commit -m "Describe what you've changed"</code>.

</ul>

<p>
Each of these commands leverages <code>git diff</code> to help you confidently manage and review your changes throughout your development process.
</p>



<div id="Git Diff-Example Workflow-Can you git diff a single file that hasn't been staged?"><h4 id="Can you git diff a single file that hasn't been staged?" class="header"><a href="#Git Diff-Example Workflow-Can you git diff a single file that hasn't been staged?">Can you git diff a single file that hasn't been staged?</a></h4></div>

<p>
Yes, you can. To view unstaged changes for a single file in your repository, simply specify the file name with the <code>git diff</code> command. For example, if you want to see the differences for a file named <code>example.txt</code> that hasn't been staged, you can run:
</p>
  
<pre bash>
git diff example.txt
</pre>

<p>
This command shows the differences between your working directory version of <code>example.txt</code> and the version in the index (what you're about to commit). If the file is already tracked by Git and you have unstagged modifications, you'll see a diff detailing the changes.
</p>

<div id="Git Diff-Example Workflow-A couple of notes:"><h3 id="A couple of notes:" class="header"><a href="#Git Diff-Example Workflow-A couple of notes:">A couple of notes:</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Git Diff-Example Workflow-A couple of notes:-Tracked Files"></span><strong id="Tracked Files">Tracked Files</strong>: This works for tracked files where changes have been made but not staged. If the file is new and untracked, git diff won’t produce any output unless you force Git to compare it (for instance, by using --no-index).

<li>
<span id="Git Diff-Example Workflow-A couple of notes:-Comparing to HEAD"></span><strong id="Comparing to HEAD">Comparing to HEAD</strong>: If you want to see the differences between your current working file and the last committed version (HEAD), you can do:

</ul>
  
<pre bash>
git diff HEAD example.txt
</pre>

<p>
This can be useful if you’ve made changes that aren't staged but want to see how they differ from what’s in the latest commit.
</p>

<p>
Using these commands, you can focus on a specific file to review changes before deciding to add or commit them.
