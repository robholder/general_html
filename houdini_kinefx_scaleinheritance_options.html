<p>
In Houdini, <code>scale inheritance</code> refers to how the scaling transformations of parent objects affect their child objects. This concept is crucial for maintaining consistent transformations across a hierarchy of objects.
</p>

<p>
Houdini provides several modes for scale inheritance:
</p>

<div id="KineFX - Scale Inheritance-Default"><h3 id="Default" class="header"><a href="#KineFX - Scale Inheritance-Default">Default</a></h3></div>
<p>
Simple inheritance where the world transformation is the product of the local transformation and the parent's world transformation.
</p>

<div id="KineFX - Scale Inheritance-OffsetOnly"><h3 id="OffsetOnly" class="header"><a href="#KineFX - Scale Inheritance-OffsetOnly">OffsetOnly</a></h3></div>
<p>
The child does not scale with the parent's local scales, but the local translation is scaled.
</p>

<div id="KineFX - Scale Inheritance-OffsetAndScale"><h3 id="OffsetAndScale" class="header"><a href="#KineFX - Scale Inheritance-OffsetAndScale">OffsetAndScale</a></h3></div>
<p>
The local translation is scaled as before, but the parent's local scaling is also reapplied by the child in local space.
</p>

<div id="KineFX - Scale Inheritance-ScaleOnly"><h3 id="ScaleOnly" class="header"><a href="#KineFX - Scale Inheritance-ScaleOnly">ScaleOnly</a></h3></div>
<p>
The local translation is not scaled, but the parent's local scaling is reapplied by the child in local space.
</p>

<div id="KineFX - Scale Inheritance-Ignore"><h3 id="Ignore" class="header"><a href="#KineFX - Scale Inheritance-Ignore">Ignore</a></h3></div>
<p>
The child completely ignores any parent local scaling.
</p>


<p>
These modes allow for flexible control over how scaling transformations are propagated through a hierarchy, enabling more precise and predictable behavior in complex scenes.
</p>

<div id="Setting the Mode"><h1 id="Setting the Mode" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode">Setting the Mode</a></h1></div>

<p>
I don't know of any way to set these modes, other than with an <code>Attribute Wrangle</code> node. There must be other ways, but a search as so far not yielded any information.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Attribute Wrangle</code>:

<ul>
<li>
Drop this node after an item (joint, point, geo, whatever):

<ul>
<li>
Set a VEXPression like so:

<ul>
<li>
<code>i@scaleinheritance = chi("scale_inheritance");</code>

<li>
Click on the little slider tool to evoke the parameter on the panel.

<li>
<code>i</code> indicates you are setting an integer. The settings are:

<ul>
<li>
0 = <code>Default</code>

<li>
1 = <code>OffsetOnly</code>

<li>
2 = <code>OffsetAndScale</code>

<li>
3 = <code>ScaleOnly</code>

<li>
4 = <code>Ignore</code>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes"><h2 id="Breakdown Of Modes" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes">Breakdown Of Modes</a></h2></div>
<p>
Let's break down the different scale inheritance modes in Houdini:
</p>

<div id="Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-Default Mode"><h3 id="Default Mode" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-Default Mode">Default Mode</a></h3></div>

<p>
Scale Inheritance: Both the size and position of the child object are influenced by the parent's transformations.
</p>

<p>
Example: If you scale the parent cube by a factor of 2, the child sphere will also scale by a factor of 2, and if you move the parent cube, the child sphere will move accordingly. Essentially, all transformations (scaling, translation, rotation) are inherited by the child.
</p>

<div id="Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-OffsetOnly Mode"><h3 id="OffsetOnly Mode" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-OffsetOnly Mode">OffsetOnly Mode</a></h3></div>

<p>
Scale Inheritance: The child's size does not change with the parent's scaling.
</p>

<p>
Local Translation Is Scaled: The child's position relative to the parent is affected by the parent's scaling.
</p>

<p>
Example: If the parent cube is scaled by a factor of 2, the child sphere remains the same size but is moved further away, proportional to the parent's new size.
</p>

<div id="Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-OffsetAndScale Mode"><h3 id="OffsetAndScale Mode" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-OffsetAndScale Mode">OffsetAndScale Mode</a></h3></div>

<p>
Scale Inheritance: The child's size is affected by the parent's scaling, and it also considers the parent's local scaling.
</p>

<p>
Local Translation Is Scaled: The child's position relative to the parent is affected by the parent's scaling.
</p>

<p>
Example: If the parent cube is scaled by a factor of 2, the child sphere will also scale by a factor of 2, and its position will be proportionally affected by the parent's new size. Both size and position of the child are adjusted.
</p>

<div id="Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-ScaleOnly Mode"><h3 id="ScaleOnly Mode" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-ScaleOnly Mode">ScaleOnly Mode</a></h3></div>

<p>
Scale Inheritance: The child's size is affected by the parent's scaling.
</p>

<p>
Local Translation Not Scaled: The child's position remains unchanged.
</p>

<p>
Example: If the parent cube is scaled by a factor of 2, the child sphere will also scale by a factor of 2, but its position relative to the parent will not change.
</p>

<div id="Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-Ignore Mode"><h3 id="Ignore Mode" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Breakdown Of Modes-Ignore Mode">Ignore Mode</a></h3></div>

<p>
Scale Inheritance: The child's size and position are not affected by the parent's transformations.
</p>

<p>
Example: If the parent cube is scaled by a factor of 2 or moved, the child sphere remains completely unaffected in both size and position.
</p>

<p>
These modes provide various levels of control over how scaling transformations are applied in a hierarchy, allowing for more precise and predictable behavior in complex scenes.
</p>


<div id="Setting the Mode-Difference Between Default Mode and OffsetAndScale Mode"><h2 id="Difference Between Default Mode and OffsetAndScale Mode" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Difference Between Default Mode and OffsetAndScale Mode">Difference Between Default Mode and OffsetAndScale Mode</a></h2></div>

<p>
Let's break down the differences between Default Mode and OffsetAndScale Mode in Houdini's scale inheritance:
</p>

<div id="Setting the Mode-Difference Between Default Mode and OffsetAndScale Mode-Default Mode"><h3 id="Default Mode" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Difference Between Default Mode and OffsetAndScale Mode-Default Mode">Default Mode</a></h3></div>

<p>
Scale Inheritance: Both the size and position of the child object are influenced by the parent's transformations.
</p>

<p>
Example: If you scale the parent cube by a factor of 2, the child sphere will also scale by a factor of 2. If you move the parent cube, the child sphere will move accordingly. Essentially, all transformations (scaling, translation, rotation) are inherited by the child.
</p>

<div id="Setting the Mode-Difference Between Default Mode and OffsetAndScale Mode-OffsetAndScale Mode"><h3 id="OffsetAndScale Mode" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Difference Between Default Mode and OffsetAndScale Mode-OffsetAndScale Mode">OffsetAndScale Mode</a></h3></div>

<p>
Scale Inheritance: The child's size is affected by the parent's scaling, and it also considers the parent's local scaling.
</p>

<p>
Local Translation Is Scaled: The child's position relative to the parent is affected by the parent's scaling.
</p>

<p>
Example: If you scale the parent cube by a factor of 2, the child sphere will also scale by a factor of 2, and its position will be proportionally affected by the parent's new size. Both size and position of the child are adjusted.
</p>

<div id="Setting the Mode-Key Difference"><h2 id="Key Difference" class="header"><a href="#Setting the Mode-Key Difference">Key Difference</a></h2></div>

<p>
Default Mode applies all transformations (scaling, translation, rotation) from the parent to the child.
</p>

<p>
OffsetAndScale Mode scales both the size and the position of the child relative to the parent's scaling, but it's more focused on applying the parent's local scaling specifically to the child's local space.
</p>

<p>
In essence, OffsetAndScale Mode offers more nuanced control over how the child's position is influenced by the parent's scaling, whereas Default Mode straightforwardly applies all the parent's transformations to the child.
</p>


<div id="What's the Purpose of Ignore Mode?"><h1 id="What's the Purpose of Ignore Mode?" class="header"><a href="#What's the Purpose of Ignore Mode?">What's the Purpose of Ignore Mode?</a></h1></div>

<p>
"Ignore Mode" can be particularly useful in specific scenarios where you want the child object to remain completely independent of the parent's transformations. Here are some points highlighting its importance:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Isolation: If you want to animate or transform a parent object without affecting its child objects, "Ignore Mode" allows you to do so. The child objects will not inherit any transformations (scale, translation, rotation) from the parent.

<li>
Consistency: Sometimes, certain child objects need to maintain a consistent appearance or position regardless of changes to the parent. "Ignore Mode" ensures that these child objects remain unaffected by any transformations applied to the parent.

<li>
Control: It provides finer control over the hierarchy. If you have a complex scene where some objects need to move together while others need to remain static, "Ignore Mode" helps you achieve this without manually adjusting each child object's transformation.

<li>
Complex Rigging: In character rigging or other complex setups, you might have specific nodes or objects that should not be influenced by their parents. "Ignore Mode" allows these nodes to operate independently, ensuring that the rig behaves as intended.

<li>
Optimization: In some cases, avoiding unnecessary transformations on certain objects can improve performance, especially in large and complex scenes.

<li>
In essence, "Ignore Mode" provides flexibility and control, allowing you to create more predictable and intentional animations and transformations in Houdini.

</ul>
