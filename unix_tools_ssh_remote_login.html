<p>
Yes, you can securely access your macOS device's shell environment and files from another computer over the internet using its built-in Remote Login feature, which is based on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. 
</p>

<div id="SSH Remote Login-Method 1: Using Built-in Remote Login (SSH/SFTP)"><h3 id="Method 1: Using Built-in Remote Login (SSH/SFTP)" class="header"><a href="#SSH Remote Login-Method 1: Using Built-in Remote Login (SSH/SFTP)">Method 1: Using Built-in Remote Login (SSH/SFTP)</a></h3></div>

<p>
This method provides command-line access (shell) and secure file transfer (SFTP).

<ul>
<li>
Open System Settings (from the Apple menu, select System Settings, then click General in the sidebar).

<li>
Click on Sharing, then click the information icon (i) next to Remote Login.

<li>
Turn on the Remote Login service toggle.

<li>
In "Allow access for", choose whether to allow access for "All users" or "Only these users", and select the specific users who can log in remotely.

<li>
If you need to transfer files, ensure "Allow full disk access for remote users" is enabled, if required.

<li>
Note the SSH command displayed, which will show your username and the Mac's local network IP address (e.g., ssh username@10.0.1.2). 

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="SSH Remote Login-Method 1: Using Built-in Remote Login (SSH/SFTP)-To connect over the internet:-Network Configuration"></span><strong id="Network Configuration">Network Configuration</strong>: Your Mac is likely behind a router and assigned a local (private) IP address. To access it over the internet, you will need to configure port forwarding on your router to direct incoming traffic on port 22 (the default SSH port) to your Mac's internal IP address.

<li>
<span id="SSH Remote Login-Method 1: Using Built-in Remote Login (SSH/SFTP)-To connect over the internet:-Connecting"></span><strong id="Connecting">Connecting</strong>: On the other computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux):

<ul>

Open a Terminal app or an SSH client (like PuTTY on Windows).

<li>
Use the public IP address of your router (which you can find by searching online for "What's my IP") in the SSH command format: ssh username@your_router_public_ip.

<li>
Enter your password when prompted to establish a secure connection.

<li>
You can now use the shell environment and transfer files using SFTP clients. 

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
For simpler and more secure internet access without complex router configuration, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service or a dedicated third-party remote access application. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="SSH Remote Login-Method 2: Using a VPN or Third-Party Software-VPN"></span><strong id="VPN">VPN</strong>: A VPN creates a secure, private connection between your computers over the internet, making them behave as if they are on the same local network. This allows you to connect using the simpler local IP address mentioned in Method 1. Tools like Tailscale can simplify this.

<li>
<span id="SSH Remote Login-Method 2: Using a VPN or Third-Party Software-Third-Party Tools"></span><strong id="Third-Party Tools">Third-Party Tools</strong>: Software like Chrome Remote Desktop, AnyDesk, or Splashtop offer user-friendly, cross-platform solutions for both graphical control and file transfer over the internet, often without needing port forwarding. 

</ul>
<p>
Security Note: Exposing your Mac directly to the internet via port forwarding increases security risks. Using strong passwords or, preferably, SSH keys for authentication is highly recommended for enhanced security.

<p>
Yes, you absolutely can copy files back and forth between a Linux machine and a macOS machine over the internet, provided you have SSH access set up correctly. The SSH protocol includes built-in command-line tools for secure file transfer: scp (Secure Copy Protocol) and sftp (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

<span id="Login from Linux to MacOS-Prerequisites-Remote Login enabled on Mac"></span><strong id="Remote Login enabled on Mac">Remote Login enabled on Mac</strong>: Ensure you have enabled Remote Login in your macOS System Settings to allow SSH connections.

<li>
<span id="Login from Linux to MacOS-Prerequisites-Network Access"></span><strong id="Network Access">Network Access</strong>: Both computers must be connected to the internet, and the necessary network configurations (like port forwarding on the macOS machine's router) must be in place, as standard SSH operates on port 22.

<li>
<span id="Login from Linux to MacOS-Prerequisites-Credentials"></span><strong id="Credentials">Credentials</strong>: You need a valid username and password (or SSH keys for passwordless authentication) for the macOS machine. 

</ul>
<div id="Login from Linux to MacOS-Prerequisites-File Transfer Methods"><h4 id="File Transfer Methods" class="header"><a href="#Login from Linux to MacOS-Prerequisites-File Transfer Methods">File Transfer Methods</a></h4></div>

<p>
You can perform file transfers from either the Linux machine (initiating a pull from or push to the Mac) or from the Mac side. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Using scp (Secure Copy)

<ul>
<li>
scp is a command-line tool that uses the SSH protocol and is ideal for quick file or directory transfers. 

</ul>
<li>
Copy a file from the Linux machine (local) to the Mac (remote):

</ol>
  
<pre bash>
scp /path/to/local/file username@mac_public_ip:/path/to/remote/directory/
</pre>
<p>
Use code with caution.
</p>

<p>
Example: scp important_doc.txt johnny@203.0.113.15:/Users/johnny/Documents/
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Copy a file from the Mac (remote) to the Linux machine (local):

</ul>
  
<pre bash>
scp username@mac_public_ip:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory/
</pre>
<p>
Use code with caution.
</p>

<p>
Example: scp johnny@203.0.113.15:/Users/johnny/Desktop/screenshot.png /home/linuxuser/Downloads/
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Copy an entire directory: Use the -r (recursive) flag.

</ul>
  
<pre bash>
scp -r /path/to/local/dir username@mac_public_ip:/path/to/remote/directory/
</pre>
<p>
Use code with caution.
</p>

 
<ol>
<li>
Using sftp (SSH File Transfer Protocol) 

<ul>
<li>
sftp provides an interactive command-line interface that functions similarly to an old-school FTP client but over a secure SSH connection. 

</ul>
<li>
From the Linux terminal, start an sftp session:

</ol>
  
<pre bash>
sftp username@mac_public_ip
</pre>
<p>
Use code with caution.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Once connected (after entering your password), you can use sftp commands:

<li>

</ul>
<div id="Login from Linux to MacOS-Prerequisites-Alternative: Graphical Clients"><h4 id="Alternative: Graphical Clients" class="header"><a href="#Login from Linux to MacOS-Prerequisites-Alternative: Graphical Clients">Alternative: Graphical Clients</a></h4></div>

<p>
If you prefer a graphical user interface over command-line tools, you can use cross-platform SFTP clients such as FileZilla (available for both Linux and Mac). These clients allow you to drag and drop files between the two machines securely.

<p>
Yes, using SSH-based methods (ssh, scp, and sftp) is a standard and highly effective approach for managing files and repositories remotely. It is suitable for your workflow of developing on the macOS device and executing files on the Linux machine.
</p>

<p>
Here is a breakdown of why this approach works well and how to leverage it effectively:
</p>

<div id="Login from Linux to MacOS-Transferring Files-Why this approach is good:"><h3 id="Why this approach is good:" class="header"><a href="#Login from Linux to MacOS-Transferring Files-Why this approach is good:">Why this approach is good:</a></h3></div>

<ul>

<p>
You have two primary options depending on which machine holds the definitive "source" of the code.
</p>

<div id="Login from Linux to MacOS-Transferring Files-How to adapt the workflow:-Option 1: Mac is the Development Machine (Recommended)"><h4 id="Option 1: Mac is the Development Machine (Recommended)" class="header"><a href="#Login from Linux to MacOS-Transferring Files-How to adapt the workflow:-Option 1: Mac is the Development Machine (Recommended)">Option 1: Mac is the Development Machine (Recommended)</a></h4></div>

<p>
This is the scenario you described: you develop, commit, and build on the macOS machine, then transfer the final output (e.g., compiled binaries, final scripts, container images) to the Linux machine for execution or testing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Login from Linux to MacOS-Transferring Files-How to adapt the workflow:-Option 1: Mac is the Development Machine (Recommended)-Develop &amp; Commit"></span><strong id="Develop &amp; Commit">Develop &amp; Commit</strong>: Work within the repository on your Mac's filesystem. Use your local SSH session to manage Git commands.

<li>
<span id="Login from Linux to MacOS-Transferring Files-How to adapt the workflow:-Option 1: Mac is the Development Machine (Recommended)-Transfer Files"></span><strong id="Transfer Files">Transfer Files</strong>: Use scp or, even better, rsync to transfer only the necessary files to the Linux machine.

<ul>
<li>
rsync is more efficient than scp for frequent updates because it only copies the changes (deltas) between files, not the entire file each time.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Example rsync command:
</p>
  
<pre bash>
rsync -avz /path/to/mac/build/folder/ username@linux_ip:/path/to/execution/folder/
</pre>
<p>
Use code with caution.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Execute: Use the SSH session to execute the files on the Linux machine:

</ul>
  
<pre bash>
ssh username@linux_ip './start_script.sh'
</pre>
<p>
Use code with caution.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you could keep the main repo on the Linux machine and SSH into the Linux machine from the Mac to do all your work remotely.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You would use a feature called SSHFS (SSH Filesystem) to mount the remote Linux directory onto your local Mac desktop as if it were a local drive. This lets you use your favorite local macOS editor while the files physically reside on the Linux machine.
