<p>
Select text in Visual mode by pressing v and using arrow keys or V to select lines.

<p>
Invoke the mapping by pressing your leader key followed by tc (e.g., \tc if your leader key is \).

<pre vim>
vnoremap &lt;leader&gt;tc: Creates a Visual mode mapping.

:s/\&lt;\w\+/\u\0/g&lt;CR&gt;: Matches each word (\w\+) and converts the first character to uppercase (\u\0).

gv: Reselects the previously visually selected text.

:s/\(\&lt;\w\)\(\w\+\)/\1\L\2/g&lt;CR&gt;gv: Matches the first letter (\(\&lt;\w\)) and the rest of the word (\(\w\+\)) separately, then converts the rest of the word to lowercase (\L\2).

<p>
Select the text in Visual mode (press v and use arrow keys or V to select lines).
</p>

<p>
Invoke the mapping by pressing your leader key followed by mc (e.g., \mc if your leader key is \).
</p>

<p>
This mapping converts the selected text to CamelCase by capitalizing the first letter of each word, removing spaces, and ensuring the first character of the selection is lowercase.
</p>

<div id="CamelCase Mapping-Explanation:-Here's The Breakdown"><h4 id="Here's The Breakdown" class="header"><a href="#CamelCase Mapping-Explanation:-Here's The Breakdown">Here's The Breakdown</a></h4></div>

<pre vim>
vnoremap &lt;leader&gt;mc "This creates a Visual mode mapping that activates when you press the leader key followed by mc (you can replace &lt;leader&gt; with your chosen leader key, often \ by default).

" Convert the First Character of Each Word to Uppercase:

:s/\&lt;./\u&amp;/g&lt;CR&gt; "This substitution command (:s) matches the first character of each word (\&lt;.) and converts it to uppercase (\u&amp;). The g flag ensures this is applied globally across the selected text.

&lt;CR&gt; "Simulates pressing Enter to execute the command.

" Reselect the Visual Selection:

gv "This command reselects the previously visually selected text.

" Remove Spaces and Convert the Following Character to Uppercase:

:s/\s\+\(\w\)/\1/g&lt;CR&gt; "This substitution command matches one or more spaces (\s\+) followed by a word character (\(\w\)). It removes the spaces and keeps the matched character (\1). The matched character remains uppercase due to the previous step.

&lt;CR&gt; "Simulates pressing Enter to execute the command.

" Reselect the Visual Selection Again:

gv "Reselects the previously visually selected text.

" Convert the First Character of the Entire Selection to Lowercase:

norm guiw "This Normal mode command (norm) moves the cursor to the beginning of the selection (g), moves to the first character (0), and converts it to lowercase (guiw).
