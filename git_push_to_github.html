<p>
As far as I can tell, using HTTPS with Github means having to enter username and password with every git interaction, whereas using SSH means the SSH key takes care of security. I'm not entirely sure though.
</p>

<pre>
# Navigate to or create a working directory/project
# Then setup git:
# the -b option is only available in versions after 2.28.
git init -b main
# prior to version 2.28, use:
git init
# If you forget to name the new branch 'main', or if prior to 2.28 you can run this after 'init':
git checkout -b main
# Add your existing files:
git add .
# commit the files:
git commit -m "first commit"
# set up repo at Github - and use the Quick setup (copy) URL. (e.g. myrepo)
# Do not create a read me!! (or there'll be a mismatch)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO
# NOTE: I need to try the SSH address here, to avoid username/password every interaction.
git remote add origin git@github:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO
# Verify new URL
git remote -v
git push -u origin main
# you'll be asked to input your (github) username
# you'll be asked for a password - this is your personal token (which is pasted somewhere safe!)
# (see below for hints on personal access tokens)

Or... To get and merge the 'changes' from a remote repo:

<pre>
git pull

<ul>
<li>
Go to (or setup) a repo on Github.

<li>
Two options:

<ul>
<li>
Click on 'Code' and use the HTTPS option (will need user/token every interaction)

<li>
Click on 'Code' and use the SSH option (will use the SSH key, so no password required)

</ul>
<li>
Click on the copy button at the end of the HTTPS/SSH line

<li>
In the commandline:
<pre>
# For HTTPS:
# git clone, and paste the URL to your repo:
git clone http://githb.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO
# or for SSH
# git clone, and paste the SSH address for the rep:
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO
</pre>

<li>
it turns out you need to set up a token instead of the password for the HTTPS.

<li>
GitHub -&gt; Settings -&gt; Developer Settings - and set up a token

<li>
copy and paste this token when the terminal on MacOS asks for a password (and it doesn't show anything, but it works)

</ul>
 
<div id="Push to, or get from, GitHub-Note on SSH"><h2 id="Note on SSH" class="header"><a href="#Push to, or get from, GitHub-Note on SSH">Note on SSH</a></h2></div>

<p>
ssh-agent is not persistent across reboots. You need to start agent...
</p>
<pre>
eval $(ssh-agent)
</pre>
<p>
...and then you need to add them manually after reboot or setup some script to load them automatically.
</p>

<p>
If you have have your keys in "default location", like ~/.ssh/id_rsa, it should be enough to run...
</p>
<pre>
ssh-add
</pre>
<p>
...otherwise you need to run...
</p>
<pre>
ssh-add path/to/your/private/key.
</pre>
