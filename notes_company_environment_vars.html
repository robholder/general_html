If you're logging into a workstation as a new user and want to gather clues about how the system is set up and deployed, there are several ways to investigate:
</p>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Check the Operating System and Version"><h2 id="Check the Operating System and Version" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Check the Operating System and Version">Check the Operating System and Version</a></h2></div>

<p>
Run:
</p>
<pre sh>
uname -a    # Linux/macOS: Shows OS and kernel version
lsb_release -a  # Debian-based: Shows detailed OS info
cat /etc/os-release  # Linux: System-wide OS info
systeminfo  # Windows: Shows OS version and system details
</pre>

<p>
This helps determine if you're on Windows, Linux, or macOS, and which distribution/version is in use.
</p>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Identify Configuration and Deployment Tools"><h2 id="Identify Configuration and Deployment Tools" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Identify Configuration and Deployment Tools">Identify Configuration and Deployment Tools</a></h2></div>

<p>
Studios and companies often use automated deployment systems. Check for common ones:
</p>
<pre sh>
dpkg -l | grep ansible    # Linux: Checks if Ansible is installed
rpm -qa | grep puppet     # Red Hat/CentOS: Checks for Puppet
which chef-client         # Checks if Chef is installed
ps aux | grep salt-minion # Checks for SaltStack running
</pre>

<p>
If any of these tools are present, it indicates that system-wide configuration is managed centrally.
</p>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Look at Environment Variables"><h2 id="Look at Environment Variables" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Look at Environment Variables">Look at Environment Variables</a></h2></div>

<p>
Run:
</p>
<pre sh>
env  # Linux/macOS: Lists all environment variables
set  # Windows: Displays variables set on the system
echo $SHELL  # Linux/macOS: Shows which shell is used
</pre>

<p>
Checking environment variables can reveal things like network paths, software configurations, and deployment details.
</p>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Explore Network and Mounted Directories"><h2 id="Explore Network and Mounted Directories" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Explore Network and Mounted Directories">Explore Network and Mounted Directories</a></h2></div>

<p>
Studios often mount shared directories across a network. Check for them:
</p>
<pre sh>
df -h  # Linux/macOS: Lists mounted network drives
mount  # Linux/macOS: Shows all mounted filesystems
net use  # Windows: Lists connected network drives
</pre>

<p>
This helps identify shared storage locations or network-based configurations.
</p>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Review Login Scripts and System-Wide Configurations"><h2 id="Review Login Scripts and System-Wide Configurations" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Review Login Scripts and System-Wide Configurations">Review Login Scripts and System-Wide Configurations</a></h2></div>

<p>
Check files that may set global environment variables and configurations:
</p>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Review Login Scripts and System-Wide Configurations-Linux/macOS:"><h3 id="Linux/macOS:" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Review Login Scripts and System-Wide Configurations-Linux/macOS:">Linux/macOS:</a></h3></div>

<pre sh>
cat /etc/profile
cat ~/.bashrc
cat /etc/environment
</pre>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Review Login Scripts and System-Wide Configurations-Windows:"><h3 id="Windows:" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Review Login Scripts and System-Wide Configurations-Windows:">Windows:</a></h3></div>

<pre powershell>
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment'
</pre>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Check Package Managers"><h2 id="Check Package Managers" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Check Package Managers">Check Package Managers</a></h2></div>

<p>
Studios may use package managers to install software:
</p>

<pre sh>
dpkg -l  # Debian-based Linux
rpm -qa  # Red Hat-based Linux
brew list  # macOS (Homebrew)
winget list  # Windows Package Manager
</pre>

<p>
This will show which tools and configurations are installed.
</p>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Investigate Group Policy (Windows)"><h2 id="Investigate Group Policy (Windows)" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Investigate Group Policy (Windows)">Investigate Group Policy (Windows)</a></h2></div>

<p>
Organizations using Active Directory enforce configurations using Group Policy:
</p>

<pre powershell>
gpresult /r  # Shows applied policies for the logged-in user
</pre>

<p>
If policies are enforced, the system is likely part of a domain-managed network.
</p>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Identify Remote Deployment Tools"><h2 id="Identify Remote Deployment Tools" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Identify Remote Deployment Tools">Identify Remote Deployment Tools</a></h2></div>

<p>
Many large organizations use tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud-based provisioning:
</p>

<pre sh>
docker ps  # Lists running containers (if Docker is used)
kubectl get nodes  # Lists Kubernetes nodes (if used)
</pre>

<p>
This could indicate cloud-based rendering or virtualized workstations.
</p>

<div id="How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Identify Remote Deployment Tools-Summary"><h3 id="Summary" class="header"><a href="#How Does The Company Or Studio Set Environment Variables?-Identify Remote Deployment Tools-Summary">Summary</a></h3></div>


<ul>
<li>
 Check OS &amp; version (<code>uname -a</code>, <code>systeminfo</code>) 

<li>
 Look for deployment tools (<code>ansible</code>, <code>puppet</code>, <code>chef</code>) 

<li>
 Scan environment variables (<code>env</code>, <code>set</code>)
