Greetings, Terry, Rob and Ian!  As you may have guessed you're joining us on sequence 2230, which is being animated by our pals at Studio Mir.  Yay!!
Terry and Rob, I'm going to try to get you your first shot asap.  Ian, I've got your shot picked out but it's lower priority for you since you've got FB shots still on your plate.
Please watch this video before you start on your shots:

/shows/avoa/documentation/comp/Comp_Launch_Recordings/Korea_Launches/2230/20250723_sq2230_comp_launch_recording.mp4

We're all going to get together at 4:00 so I can do a quick tech launch on what we're getting in in our precomps.  Then we'll do individual launches on your new shots.  Bekah and Rupali you can bail for that part if you like.
Please familiarize yourselves with the keys:

<li>
In the key, Katara is front lit with the moon and has the warm backlit from the ship.

<li>
In this shot, they are in the hero airship which has more of a warm light rather than the lanterns in the Denied ship.

<li>
We can push the stylizing and simplify the reflection of the glass in the window.

<li>
Feel free to start on BG and Katara. Look through the keys to draw inspiration and ideas. Use key 0200 as a rough color guide.

</ul>
