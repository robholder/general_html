<p>
An ACES workflow is all about ensuring consistency and fidelity across your entire production—from capturing to final output—using a standardized, scene‑referred color encoding system. Here’s a breakdown of how each step works in Nuke when you're using an ACES pipeline:
</p>

<div id="ACES Workflow-Standardized Input Conversion"><h2 id="Standardized Input Conversion" class="header"><a href="#ACES Workflow-Standardized Input Conversion">Standardized Input Conversion</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Standardized Input Conversion-Camera &amp; Input Transforms"></span><strong id="Camera &amp; Input Transforms">Camera &amp; Input Transforms</strong>: When you bring in your footage, each source might have a very different color profile (Rec.709, log-encoded camera files, etc.). In an ACES workflow you use input transforms (often through OCIO-based nodes) to convert these varying source color spaces into the ACES color space (commonly ACES2065‑1 or ACEScg for the working space). This conversion ensures that every asset in your comp is treated with the same scientific consistency.

<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Standardized Input Conversion-Assigning the Right Transforms"></span><strong id="Assigning the Right Transforms">Assigning the Right Transforms</strong>: In Nuke, you might use an OCIOColorSpace node or specify a working config that automatically converts your Read node data into ACES—setting the stage so all your material is now in a linear, wide-gamut, scene‑referred space.

</ul>
<div id="ACES Workflow-Working in ACES"><h2 id="Working in ACES" class="header"><a href="#ACES Workflow-Working in ACES">Working in ACES</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Working in ACES-The Working Color Space"></span><strong id="The Working Color Space">The Working Color Space</strong>: Most ACES workflows use ACEScg (or occasionally ACEScc for grading) as the working space. This is where all compositing, keying, and grading occurs. Since ACES is scene-linear, all your operations—be they blending, filtering, or color adjustments—happen in a linear context. This is critical for clean, mathematically correct manipulations.

<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Working in ACES-Viewer Setup"></span><strong id="Viewer Setup">Viewer Setup</strong>: Your Nuke Viewer should be configured to include an appropriate display transform. For example, you might use an ACES-to-Rec.709 (or ACES-to-DCI-P3) transform so that what you see on screen simulates the final display environment. This means while your node tree operates in ACES, you’re previewing the work as it will appear in its intended output format.

<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Working in ACES-Non-Destructive Adjustments"></span><strong id="Non-Destructive Adjustments">Non-Destructive Adjustments</strong>: With everything standardized, you can safely apply Grade nodes, ColorCorrect nodes, or any custom adjustments without having to worry about inconsistent behavior from mixed color spaces.

</ul>
<div id="ACES Workflow-Intermediate &amp; Final Output"><h2 id="Intermediate &amp; Final Output" class="header"><a href="#ACES Workflow-Intermediate &amp; Final Output">Intermediate &amp; Final Output</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Intermediate &amp; Final Output-Intermediate Renders (EXRs)"></span><strong id="Intermediate Renders (EXRs)">Intermediate Renders (EXRs)</strong>: In an ACES workflow, intermediate files (often saved as EXRs) are typically written out in the ACES working color space. Keeping them in a linear scene‑referred format preserves your full dynamic range and provides maximum flexibility for re‑grading or further compositing.

<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Intermediate &amp; Final Output-Final Conform Conversion"></span><strong id="Final Conform Conversion">Final Conform Conversion</strong>: Before delivery, you’ll apply a final color transform to convert from ACES to the target display-referred space. For example:

<ul>
<li>
Theatrical (Cinema): Convert to DCI‑P3 for film or DCP packages.

<li>
Broadcast/HD TV: Convert to Rec.709.

<li>
Web/Streaming: Convert to sRGB or Rec.709 as appropriate.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
This conversion is generally done as the last node in your comp (using OCIO or dedicated ACES conversion nodes) so that the final output file has the correct look for its intended medium.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Intermediate &amp; Final Output-Output File Formats"></span><strong id="Output File Formats">Output File Formats</strong>: Depending on the delivery requirements, your final output might be a QuickTime with ProRes for TV, a DPX sequence for cinema, or even a compressed format like MP4 for online streaming. The key point is that while your master comp is maintained in the high-quality ACES space, your final output is transformed to match the display’s characteristics.

</ul>
<div id="ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?"><h2 id="Why Use ACES?" class="header"><a href="#ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?">Why Use ACES?</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?-Consistency"></span><strong id="Consistency">Consistency</strong>: ACES provides a common language across different devices and departments. This means that what you see in Nuke (with the proper transforms applied) will match what others see on their calibrated displays.

<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?-Accuracy"></span><strong id="Accuracy">Accuracy</strong>: By working in a scene‑referred, linear color space, you ensure that your compositing and grading operations are physically correct. The math behind operations like blending, filtering, and color correction relies on linear data for predictable results.

<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?-Flexibility"></span><strong id="Flexibility">Flexibility</strong>: With ACES, you can always go back to your high‑quality intermediate files and re‑grade or re‑process as needed, because you’ve preserved the full dynamic range and color fidelity during compositing.

</ul>
<div id="ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?-In Summary"><h3 id="In Summary" class="header"><a href="#ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?-In Summary">In Summary</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?-In Summary-Input"></span><strong id="Input">Input</strong>: Convert every source to ACES using the proper input transforms.

<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?-In Summary-Working"></span><strong id="Working">Working</strong>: Composite, grade, and manipulate your footage in ACES (typically ACEScg), with your viewer set to simulate the final output using a display transform.

<li>
<span id="ACES Workflow-Why Use ACES?-In Summary-Output"></span><strong id="Output">Output</strong>: Render intermediate files in ACES for maximum quality, then apply a final transform to the target color space (Rec.709, DCI‑P3, etc.) before delivering the final output in the required format.

</ul>
<p>
The ACES workflow maximizes consistency and flexibility, ensuring that all image data is treated uniformly from the very start until final delivery, no matter what the eventual viewing platform may be.
