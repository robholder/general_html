Here’s a logical breakdown of all the troubleshooting steps and solutions we explored, structured for easy reference. 📖🚀
Summary: Sourcing Scripts, Aliases, and Environment Variables
1️⃣ Understanding the Key Problem
Running bash script.sh executes the script in a subshell, meaning any export commands inside the script don’t persist in the user’s shell.
To set environment variables for the current shell, you must source the script (source script.sh).
.zshrc is a Zsh-specific file, so sourcing it incorrectly inside Bash causes errors.
2️⃣ Ensuring a Script is Properly Sourced
✔ Prevent running the script incorrectly by checking if it’s being sourced:
bash
if [[ "\({BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "\)0" ]]; then
</p>
<pre><code>echo "Error: This script must be sourced, not executed!"
echo "Use: source script.sh"
exit 1
</code></pre>
<p>
fi
🔹 This prevents execution in a subshell and forces sourcing.
3️⃣ Dynamically Inserting an Alias into .zshrc
An alias should be automatically inserted into .zshrc with the correct path, depending on where the repo is placed. ✔ To get the script directory dynamically:
bash
SCRIPT_DIR="\((cd "\)(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&amp; pwd)"
✔ To add the alias safely to .zshrc:
bash
ALIAS_CMD="alias sme='source \"$SCRIPT_DIR/cmds/script_to_source.sh\"'"
echo "\(ALIAS_CMD" &gt;&gt; "\)HOME/.zshrc"
✔ Prevent alias duplication by checking before adding:
bash
if ! grep -Fxq "\(ALIAS_CMD" "\)HOME/.zshrc"; then
</p>
<pre><code>echo "\(ALIAS_CMD" &gt;&gt; "\)HOME/.zshrc"
</code></pre>
<p>
fi
4️⃣ Ensuring Environment Variables Persist After Sourcing
If .zshrc is sourced incorrectly, the alias won’t be available immediately. The best approach: ✔ Reload .zshrc manually after modifying it:
bash
source "$HOME/.zshrc"
✔ Or, if .zshrc contains Zsh-specific syntax, use:
bash
zsh -c "source \"$HOME/.zshrc\" &amp;&amp; exec zsh"
🔹 This ensures the alias and exported variables persist properly.
5️⃣ Fixing read -p Errors in Zsh
Zsh doesn’t support read -p, so replace:
bash
read -p "Do you want to proceed? (y/n): " choice
✔ With:
bash
echo "Do you want to proceed? (y/n): "
read choice
🔹 This prevents syntax errors when running in Zsh.
6️⃣ Preventing Script Re-Sourcing (Tracking If It's Been Run)
✔ Use an environment variable to track if the script was sourced before:
bash
if <a href=" -n &quot;true&quot; .html">-n "$SCRIPT_ALREADY_SOURCED"</a>; then
</p>
<pre><code>echo "Script has already been sourced. Skipping..."
return
</code></pre>
<p>
fi
export SCRIPT_ALREADY_SOURCED=true
✔ Use a temporary file to persist tracking across sessions:
bash
if <a href=" -f &quot;/tmp/script_sourced.lock&quot; .html">-f "/tmp/script_sourced.lock"</a>; then
</p>
<pre><code>echo "Script has already been sourced. Skipping..."
return
</code></pre>
<p>
fi
touch "/tmp/script_sourced.lock"
🔹 This ensures the script isn’t reloaded multiple times.
7️⃣ Ensuring Correct Path When Sourcing Another Script
✔ $DIR must be correctly set before sourcing another script. Debug with:
bash
echo "DIR is set to: $DIR"
✔ Source another script only if it exists:
bash
if <a href=" -f &quot;/cmds/nuke_env.sh&quot; .html">-f "$DIR/cmds/nuke_env.sh"</a>; then
</p>
<pre><code>source "$DIR/cmds/nuke_env.sh"
</code></pre>
<p>
fi
🔹 Avoid path errors by confirming $DIR resolves correctly.
8️⃣ Final Debugging Tips
✔ Enable debug tracing to see script execution details:
bash
set -x
source "$DIR/cmds/nuke_env.sh"
set +x
✔ Use realpath to ensure absolute paths are resolved properly:
bash
SCRIPT_DIR=\((realpath "\)DIR")
echo "Resolved path: $SCRIPT_DIR"
🔹 This helps identify incorrect path assumptions.
Closing Thoughts
From alias insertion, sourcing scripts properly, debugging variable expansions, and ensuring persistent environment variables—this was a deep dive into Bash &amp; Zsh scripting best practices. Now, you have a structured reference to avoid pitfalls and streamline your automation! 💡💻
