Below is a walkthrough of how the find utility works, what many of its options do, and some practical examples to get you comfortable with its usage.
Basic Syntax
The general form of the command is:
bash
find [path(s)] [expression]
path(s): These are the directories where the search will begin. If you omit the path, find defaults to the current directory.
expression: This is made up of tests, actions, and operators that filter and process the list of files. The tests determine which files match and the actions (like -print or -exec) are performed on these files.
Common Options and Flags
Here’s a breakdown of many of the flags and tests you might use:
-name pattern Matches files whose names fit the given shell pattern (wildcards supported). Example: -name "*.txt" finds files ending with .txt.
-iname pattern Like -name but case insensitive. Example: -iname "*.jpg" finds .JPG as well as .jpg files.
-type [f|d|l|...] Filters files by their type. Common types include:
f – regular file
d – directory
l – symbolic link Example: -type f restricts search to regular files.
-size [+/-]n[cwkMG] Matches files according to their size.
A leading + means “greater than,” and - means “less than.”
The suffix defines the unit:
c for bytes
k for kilobytes
M for megabytes
G for gigabytes Example: -size +100M finds files larger than 100 megabytes.
-mtime n, -atime n, -ctime n Search based on time attributes (modification, access, or change time).
For these, n is measured in days.
Using +n finds files older than n days, and -n finds files newer than n days. Example: -mtime +7 finds files modified more than 7 days ago.
-perm mode Filters files by their permissions. Example: -perm 644 finds files with exactly rw-r--r-- permissions, while using a leading / or - can specify other matching rules.
-user username and -group groupname Matches files owned by a specific user or group.
-maxdepth n and -mindepth n Limit the search to certain levels in the directory tree.
-maxdepth 1 restricts the search to the specified directory without recursing into subdirectories.
-mindepth 2 starts matching only from subdirectories (skipping the top-level).
-exec command {} \; Execute an external command on each file that matches the tests. The {} is replaced by the current file's path. Example:
bash
find . -name "*.log" -exec rm {} \;
This would remove every file ending with .log in and below the current directory. Note: Some versions support + at the end instead of \; to batch-process files for efficiency:
bash
find . -name "*.log" -exec rm {} +
-print This action prints the path of a found file. It’s often optional because many versions of find default to printing if no action is given.
-delete Deletes the matching files. Be cautious with this flag because there’s no undo.
Logical Operators:
-and and -a (implicit): Both mean “and”.
-or and -o: Means “or”.
-not and !: Negates a test.
Parentheses (escaped as \( and \) on many shells) can be used to group conditions. Example:
bash
find . \( -name "<span id="find-.c&quot; -o -name &quot;"></span><strong id=".c&quot; -o -name &quot;">.c" -o -name "</strong>.h" \)
finds files that are either C source files or header files.
-prune Tells find not to descend into a directory. This is useful to exclude directories from the search. Example:
bash
find . -name ".git" -prune -o -print
This skips any directories named .git.
Practical Examples
Find All .txt Files in the Home Directory
bash
find ~/ -type f -name "*.txt"
Case-Insensitive Search for .jpg Files
bash
find . -type f -iname "*.jpg"
Find Files Larger Than 50 MB
bash
find /path/to/search -type f -size +50M
Find Files Modified More Than 30 Days Ago and List Them
bash
find . -type f -mtime +30 -print
Delete Temporary Files (with Caution!)
bash
find . -type f -name "*.tmp" -delete
Search and Execute a Command Find all .c files and search for the text “main” in them:
bash
find . -type f -name "*.c" -exec grep -H "main" {} \;
Limiting Search Depth Only search in the current directory and not in subdirectories:
bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f
How It All Works Together
When you run find, it walks the directory tree starting at the specified path(s). For each file or directory, it evaluates the test expressions. Only files that satisfy all specified conditions (or the logically combined conditions) will have the actions applied to them. This gives you enormous flexibility in precisely targeting files.
Where to Learn More
For in-depth details and more options, you can check out the manual pages with:
bash
man find
And Vim's integrated help system (if you use Vim) can also be a good example of detailed help formatting you might follow for command options in general.
By understanding the building blocks—tests, actions, and logical operators—you can start to craft your own powerful find commands instead of copying them blindly. Experimenting in a safe directory (or using -print instead of destructive actions like -delete) is a good way to learn and get comfortable with its syntax.
