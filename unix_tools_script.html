<p>
The <code>script</code> utility is a handy command-line tool available on both MacOS and Linux that records terminal sessions, capturing all input and output into a file. It's useful for logging commands, debugging, and documenting workflows.
</p>

<div id="Script-What Does script Do?"><h2 id="What Does script Do?" class="header"><a href="#Script-What Does script Do?">What Does script Do?</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
It records everything displayed in the terminal, including commands and their outputs.

<li>
Saves the session to a file for later review.

<li>
Useful for debugging, creating tutorials, or documenting processes.

<pre sh>
script mysession.log
</pre>

<p>
🔹 This creates a file called <code>mysession.log</code> and logs everything until you exit.
</p>

<p>
This is readable with a text editor, although less -r &lt;file&gt; will do a better job of making it human readable. (You can use various cat, sed or substitutions to make human formatted, but this prevents playback (on Linux).
</p>

<p>
These are not replayable on MacOS.

<p>
Since MacOS lacks some Linux features, you can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use <code>script -a</code> to append logs.

<li>
Manually add timestamps using:

</ul>
  
<pre sh>
date &gt;&gt; mysession.log
</pre>

<p>
Install the GNU version via Homebrew:
</p>

<pre sh>
brew install util-linux
</pre>

<p>
Then use gscript instead of script.
</p>

<div id="Script-Final Thoughts"><h2 id="Final Thoughts" class="header"><a href="#Script-Final Thoughts">Final Thoughts</a></h2></div>

<p>
If you're on Linux, you get more functionality with timestamps and interactive replay. If you're on MacOS, you still get basic logging but may need workarounds for advanced features.

On Linux, if you record commands only (-T specifies a 'timing' file, and -I specifies a 'commands' file):
</p>

<p>
<code>script -T &lt;file&gt; -I &lt;another_file&gt;</code>
</p>

<pre sh>
script -T timing -I commands

<p>
You can play back with <code>scriptlive</code>, and the commands will actually be re-run.

Let's dive deeper into the <code>script</code> utility, exploring its full functionality, use cases, and nuanced differences between its MacOS (BSD-based) and Linux (typically GNU util-linux) implementations.
</p>

<div id="Deep Dive-Overview"><h2 id="Overview" class="header"><a href="#Deep Dive-Overview">Overview</a></h2></div>

<p>
The <code>script</code> command is a terminal session recorder—it launches a pseudo-terminal (pty) and logs all that appears in your session (both output and keystrokes) to a file (by default a file named <code>typescript</code>). This makes it invaluable for debugging, creating tutorials, archiving sessions, or even for legal/audit purposes where a record of commands matters.
</p>

<div id="Deep Dive-Overview-Core Functionality"><h3 id="Core Functionality" class="header"><a href="#Deep Dive-Overview-Core Functionality">Core Functionality</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Session Recording When you run:

</ul>
  
<pre sh>
script mysession.log
</pre>
<p>
the command starts a new shell (or command) with a forked pseudo-terminal so that every character you see on the screen is also written to mysession.log.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Termination You can end the recording by typing exit or pressing <code>&lt;ctrl&gt; d</code>

<li>
Playback &amp; Analysis Linux distributions often offer supplementary commands like <code>scriptreplay</code> (discussed later) that can replay the session with accurate timing information.

</ul>

<p>
On many Linux systems, the GNU version of <code>script</code> supports:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>-t</code> flag: Records a separate timing file that logs the time intervals between outputs. This enables you to replay the session “as it happened.”

</ul>
  
<pre sh>
script -t timing.log session.log
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<code>scriptreplay</code>: Use this command to replay the session interactively, using both <code>session.log</code> and the timing data from <code>timing.log</code>.

</ul>
  
<pre sh>
scriptreplay timing.log session.log
</pre>

<div id="Deep Dive-Additional Nuances-Conclusion"><h3 id="Conclusion" class="header"><a href="#Deep Dive-Additional Nuances-Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></div>

<p>
The <code>script</code> utility is a powerful tool for recording terminal activities, ideal for a range of purposes from debugging to creating tutorials. While both MacOS and Linux offer this command, the Linux version tends to be more feature-rich (especially with timing and replay capabilities) due to its GNU roots, whereas MacOS's BSD implementation is simpler by design.
</p>

<p>
If you need full-fledged session replay with timing on MacOS, consider using the GNU utilities or third-party tools to enhance functionality.
</p>

<div id="A Bit of Background"><h1 id="A Bit of Background" class="header"><a href="#A Bit of Background">A Bit of Background</a></h1></div>

<p>
The <code>script</code> utility is fascinating. Here's how it works:
</p>

<p>
When you use <code>script</code> to record a shell session, it captures everything displayed in the terminal—essentially, the raw text output. This includes commands you type, their outputs, and any other text-based interactions. The playback feature replays this text output, simulating the session as it appeared during recording. However, it doesn't capture the terminal's visual appearance, such as font styles, colors, or layout settings.
</p>

<p>
If you replay the session on a different machine with a different terminal setup, the playback will adapt to the new terminal's configuration. For example, if your original terminal had specific color schemes or fonts, these won't be preserved during playback. Instead, the text will be displayed using the settings of the terminal where the playback occurs.
</p>

<p>
Linux's ability to "re-run" the session as if it's live is unique and relies on the <code>scriptreplay</code> command. This feature uses timing information recorded alongside the session to recreate the flow of commands and outputs, making it feel like an interactive replay. However, even this doesn't replicate the exact visual appearance of the original terminal.
</p>

<p>
If you're looking to preserve the appearance, you might need to use additional tools like screen recording software or terminal emulators that support exporting visual configurations.
