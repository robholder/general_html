<p>
In Nuke, the Switch node’s “which” knob isn’t a hard integer‐only pick—if you feed it a non‐integral value it will linearly interpolate between the two nearest inputs. In other words:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Let w = “which”

<li>
Let i = floor(w)

<li>
Let f = w-i

<li>
Output = input[i]×(1-f) + input[i+1]×f

</ul>
<p>
So if you only have 2 inputs (input0 and input1) and you drive which = parent.StrokeTexture + 0.99 then:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
When: StrokeTexture=0 → which=0.99 → i=0, f=0.99 → 99% input1 + 1% input0

<li>
When: StrokeTexture=0.5 → which=1.49 → i=1, f=0.49 → 51% input1 + 49% (black) if you have no input2

<li>
When: StrokeTexture=1 → which=1.99 → i=1, f=0.99 → 99% input2 + 1% input1 (or black if no input2)

</ul>
<p>
In practice, with only two inputs you’re doing a cross‐fade between them as StrokeTexture ramps from 0→1. That’s why you see the intensity moving smoothly. If you want a hard cut instead, wrap your expression in a floor() or use an integer offset:
</p>

<p>
which = floor(parent.StrokeTexture + 0.5)
</p>

<p>
That way, StrokeTexture&lt;0.5 picks input0, ≥0.5 picks input1, with no blending.
</p>

<p>
Let’s break it right down in plain English—no magic, just math:
</p>

<div id="Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Breakdown of terms-What “floor” and the fractional part mean"><h4 id="What “floor” and the fractional part mean" class="header"><a href="#Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Breakdown of terms-What “floor” and the fractional part mean">What “floor” and the fractional part mean</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
floor(w) is “w rounded down to the nearest whole number.”

<li>
floor(1.9) → 1

<li>
floor(1.0) → 1

<li>
floor(0.99) → 0

</ul>
  
<ul>
<li>
f = w – floor(w) is the fractional remainder after you take out the whole number.

<li>
if w=1.9 → floor(w)=1 → f=0.9

<li>
if w=0.4 → floor(w)=0 → f=0.4

</ul>
<div id="Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Breakdown of terms-How Switch uses them to mix two inputs Switch internally does:"><h4 id="How Switch uses them to mix two inputs Switch internally does:" class="header"><a href="#Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Breakdown of terms-How Switch uses them to mix two inputs Switch internally does:">How Switch uses them to mix two inputs Switch internally does:</a></h4></div>

<p>
out = input[i]×(1–f) + input[i+1]×f where i = floor(w) and f = fractional part of w.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If w=0 exactly → i=0, f=0 → out = input0×1 + input1×0 → input0

<li>
If w=1 exactly → i=1, f=0 → out = input1×1 + input2×0 → input1

<li>
If w=0.5 → i=0, f=0.5 → out = input0×0.5 + input1×0.5 → 50/50 blend

</ul>
<div id="Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Breakdown of terms-Why “+0.99” on your slider makes a 0→1 float turn into a smooth fade"><h4 id="Why “+0.99” on your slider makes a 0→1 float turn into a smooth fade" class="header"><a href="#Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Breakdown of terms-Why “+0.99” on your slider makes a 0→1 float turn into a smooth fade">Why “+0.99” on your slider makes a 0→1 float turn into a smooth fade</a></h4></div>

<p>
You set w = parent.StrokeTexture + 0.99 so as StrokeTexture goes from 0 → 1, w goes from 0.99 → 1.99.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
At StrokeTexture = 0 – w = 0.99 → i = floor(0.99) = 0, f = 0.99 – out = input0×(1–0.99) + input1×0.99 = 0.01·input0 + 0.99·input1 (almost entirely input1)

<li>
At StrokeTexture = 0.5 – w = 1.49 → i = 1, f = 0.49 – out = input1×(1–0.49) + input2×0.49 = 0.51·input1 + 0.49·input2

</ul>
<p>
(if you only wired two inputs, Nuke treats input2 as black/zero, so this is effectively 51% input1)
</p>

<ul>
<li>
At StrokeTexture = 1 – w = 1.99 → i = 1, f = 0.99 – out = input1×0.01 + input2×0.99 = 0.01·input1 + 0.99·black → nearly black

</ul>
<p>
In practice you wire just input0 and input1; above you’re actually fading from input1 back down to black after StrokeTexture passes ~0.51.
</p>

<div id="Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Breakdown of terms-A simpler way to get exact 0→1 cross-fade between two inputs"><h4 id="A simpler way to get exact 0→1 cross-fade between two inputs" class="header"><a href="#Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Breakdown of terms-A simpler way to get exact 0→1 cross-fade between two inputs">A simpler way to get exact 0→1 cross-fade between two inputs</a></h4></div>

<p>
If all you want is out = (1–T)·input0 + T·input1 where T runs 0→1, you can choose: w = 0.0001 + T * 0.9998 Then i = 0, f ≈ T, out = input0×(1–T) + input1×T with no weird post-fade to black.
</p>

<p>
Or just use a Keymix/Merge node’s Mix knob—that slider is designed for a straight 0–1 blend, and it never tries to treat its value as an input index.
</p>

<div id="Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Why doesn't a straight link to the values of the slider work?"><h2 id="Why doesn't a straight link to the values of the slider work?" class="header"><a href="#Switch - Blend - Non Integral Interpolation-Why doesn't a straight link to the values of the slider work?">Why doesn't a straight link to the values of the slider work?</a></h2></div>

<p>
Because “which” is actually an integer‐only knob under the hood, feeding it a raw 0-1 float from your slider will always get truncated (or rounded) to 0 - so you only ever see input0 until you hit exactly 1.0, at which point it flips to input1.
</p>

<p>
By writing
</p>

<pre plaintext>
which = parent.StrokeTexture + 0.99
</pre>

<p>
you do two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You push your 0→1 slider into the 0.99→1.99 range.

<li>
For any non‐integer “which” value, Nuke linearly interpolates between the two adjacent inputs: out = in[floor(w)](1-frac(w)) + in[floor(w)+1]frac(w)

</ul>
<p>
So:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
StrokeTexture=0 → which=0.99 → floor=0, frac=0.99 → 99% input1 + 1% input0

<li>
StrokeTexture=0.5 → which=1.49 → floor=1, frac=0.49 → 49% input2 (black if no input2) + 51% input1

<li>
StrokeTexture=1 → which=1.99 → floor=1, frac=0.99 → 99% input2 + 1% input1

</ul>
<p>
With only two inputs this effectively cross‐fades input0↔input1 as your slider moves, instead of snapping at 0/1.
</p>

<p>
If you really want a hard cut (no blend), you can wrap it in a floor or a round:
</p>

<pre plaintext>
which = floor(parent.StrokeTexture + 0.5)
</pre>

<p>
Now anything &lt;0.5 → input0, ≥0.5 → input1.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Is the Switch designed to do this +0.99 trick? It seems like a very opaque and obscure application.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
It’s not that the Switch node was explicitly built to use “+0.99”—that’s just a clever side‐effect people discovered once they realized that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Switch’s internal “which” knob is really an integer index, but it will linearly interpolate between input N and N+1 when you feed it a floating-point value.

<li>
By offsetting your 0→1 slider into 0.99→1.99, you force that interpolation window to live entirely between input0 and input1 (and never wander off into input2).

</ul>
<p>
So yes, it’s a bit of a hack—Switch wasn’t originally marketed as a tween tool. Its primary job is a fast, multi-input hard selector. But because of that interpolation quirk, folks reuse it as a built-in cross-fader when they don’t want to stack Merge/Keymix nodes.
</p>

<p>
If you find the +0.99 trick too opaque, here are a couple more explicit alternatives:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Use an Expression or KnobChanged script to snap the Switch index: • Expression on “which”:

</ul>
  
<pre plaintext>
floor(parent.StrokeTexture + 0.5)  
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
That gives you a hard cut at 0.5 with zero interpolation—more predictable if you just need an on/off toggle.

<li>
Swap in a Keymix (or Merge) for two-way blends:

<li>
Keymix has a dedicated “mix” knob (0→1) and never tries to interpret non-integer inputs.

<li>
Visually it says “A⟷B : mix,” so anyone reading the graph knows exactly what that slider does.

<li>
Build a tiny gizmo:

<li>
Expose a Boolean button (“Hard Cut?”) on your gizmo’s panel.

<li>
If Boolean=off, wire StrokeTexture straight into a Keymix/mix knob.

<li>
If Boolean=on, wire through floor(StrokeTexture+0.5) into a Switch which=0/1.

</ul>
<p>
That way you keep your intent crystal-clear: – You’re either doing a straight blend (Keymix) – Or you’re switching hard (floor() → Switch) – No more magic +0.99 offsets hidden on a mystery knob.
