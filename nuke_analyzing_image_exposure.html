<p>
This text outlines a technique in Nuke software for analyzing image exposure using the spot meter tool, allowing users to precisely adjust shadows and highlights.
</p>

<div id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Switch the Viewer to Exposure"><h2 id="Switch the Viewer to Exposure" class="header"><a href="#Analyzing Image Exposure-Switch the Viewer to Exposure">Switch the Viewer to Exposure</a></h2></div>

<p>
By switching the viewer to the spot meter (bottom-right of the Viewer pane) and setting the center f-stop to zero (<code>s</code> key for Viewer properties panel: set <code>center f-stop</code> to zero), the user can measure the exposure value of pixels relative to a neutral gray. Neutral gray can be visualized with a constant color node set to 0.18.
</p>

<p>
This method helps in identifying the exposure difference between lit and shadowed areas, which can then be used with an exposure node to apply accurate color correction to match these regions, whether on a rendered object or integrated footage. The explanation emphasizes that this technique removes the need for guesswork when balancing light and shadow.

This briefing document summarizes a useful technique presented in the provided source for analyzing and correcting exposure imbalances in Nuke. The core idea revolves around utilizing Nuke's viewer spot meter in conjunction with adjusted settings to determine the relative exposure difference between areas of an image, particularly between highlights and shadows, and then applying precise color corrections based on these measurements.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Eliminating Guesswork in Color Correction"></span><strong id="Eliminating Guesswork in Color Correction">Eliminating Guesswork in Color Correction</strong>: The primary goal of this technique is to remove the subjective "double guessing" involved in manually adjusting color corrections to balance highlights and shadows. By quantifying the exposure difference in stops, artists can apply precise corrections.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Relative Exposure Analysis"></span><strong id="Relative Exposure Analysis">Relative Exposure Analysis</strong>: The technique focuses on measuring the relative exposure of pixels compared to a defined neutral gray value (linear gray 0.18). This provides a standardized reference point for analysis.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Using the Viewer Spot Meter"></span><strong id="Using the Viewer Spot Meter">Using the Viewer Spot Meter</strong>: Nuke's viewer spot meter is the central tool. By default, it shows luminosity or f-stop information, but the key is to adjust its settings to display exposure values relative to a zero f-stop center.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Setting the Spot Meter Reference"></span><strong id="Setting the Spot Meter Reference">Setting the Spot Meter Reference</strong>: The crucial adjustment is changing the "center f-stop" in the viewer settings to zero. This aligns the spot meter's output with exposure values relative to the established gray reference.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Linear Gray (0.18) as the Zero Point"></span><strong id="Linear Gray (0.18) as the Zero Point">Linear Gray (0.18) as the Zero Point</strong>: A linear gray value of 0.18 is presented as the real-world equivalent of a gray card and serves as the zero point for the exposure value analysis. Pixels with this value will register an exposure value of zero.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Exposure Values Representing Stops"></span><strong id="Exposure Values Representing Stops">Exposure Values Representing Stops</strong>: Once the viewer settings are adjusted, the spot meter displays exposure values that directly correspond to stops. A value of +1 means the pixel is one stop brighter than the gray reference, and a value of -1 means it is one stop darker.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Measuring Shadow/Highlight Difference"></span><strong id="Measuring Shadow/Highlight Difference">Measuring Shadow/Highlight Difference</strong>: The technique involves analyzing a lit area and a corresponding shadowed area (ideally with the same texture) to determine the difference in exposure values. This difference represents the number of stops needed to compensate.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Applying Corrections with the Exposure Node"></span><strong id="Applying Corrections with the Exposure Node">Applying Corrections with the Exposure Node</strong>: The Exposure node in Nuke is used to apply the measured exposure difference. By setting the "adjust" parameter to "stops," the artist can input the calculated stop difference to precisely brighten or darken an area.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Masking for Targeted Correction"></span><strong id="Masking for Targeted Correction">Masking for Targeted Correction</strong>: Roto shapes or masks are used to isolate the areas requiring correction (e.g., the shadowed region) so that the exposure adjustment is applied only where needed.

<li>
<span id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Trick for Exposure Analysis and Color Correction-Main Themes and Key Ideas:-Applications for CG and Real-World Images"></span><strong id="Applications for CG and Real-World Images">Applications for CG and Real-World Images</strong>: The technique is demonstrated for both CG renders and real-world photographic plates, highlighting its versatility in matching lighting conditions.

"So now you'll see that if I start to analyze the pixel now instead of giving us some f-stop value that is not very useful. Now Nuke is giving us exposure value corresponding on the luminosity of the pixel that we're analyzing." (Implicitly, these values are stops once the center f-stop is zero).

<li>
"So now Nuke is telling me that this color that we're analyzing is is one stop more luminance than a gray card."

<div id="Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Spot Meter and Exposure Analysis-Quiz Answer Key"><h3 id="Quiz Answer Key" class="header"><a href="#Analyzing Image Exposure-Nuke Viewer Spot Meter and Exposure Analysis-Quiz Answer Key">Quiz Answer Key</a></h3></div>

<ol>
<li>
The default information displayed by the Nuke viewer is luminosity. You can switch to the spot meter tool for more detailed pixel analysis.

<li>
You access the viewer settings by pressing 'S' while the viewer is active. The key parameter to adjust is the "center f-stop," which should be set to zero.

<li>
Setting the "center f-stop" to zero allows the spot meter to display exposure values relative to a gray solid, providing a standardized reference for exposure analysis.

<li>
A linear gray card in Nuke is represented by a color value of 0.18. The spot meter should display an exposure value of zero when analyzing a constant with this color.

<li>
A positive exposure value indicates that the sampled pixel is brighter or has a higher luminosity than the gray solid reference.

<li>
The difference in luminosity between a lit area and a shadowed area is represented by the difference in their respective exposure values (EVs).

<li>
The Exposure node is recommended for making color correction adjustments based on spot meter analysis, particularly when set to adjust by "stops."

<li>
You ensure an Exposure node only affects a specific area by connecting a Roto node's output (defining the area as a mask) to the mask input of the Exposure node.

<li>
The exposure difference is the difference between the two values: 1.0 - (-2.0) = 3.0. You would likely use 3.0 stops to brighten the shadow area.

<li>
The spot meter and exposure analysis can be used to integrate elements by calculating the required shadow or highlight intensity based on the scene's lighting and applying that adjustment to the element using an Exposure node.
