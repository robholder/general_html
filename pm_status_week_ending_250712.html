Sarah will do the renames by hand for now. But I'll work on the tool for renaming.
</p>

<p>
Continued with Brooke's damaged files:
</p>

<pre text>
I've saved this file (which is a copy of the backup (.nk~) file for v011. I've removed any reference to 'SET' in there, but I fear this is as close as we can get, as a ton of nodes are missing from the subsequent files when you look as text.

Lisa Tse has a scene with broken gizmos/links/groups. We will have to look for how to fix on the Paramount side.
</p>

<p>
Dale asked to announce tools on the comp-brats group when they are published.
</p>

<p>
Jon Meier asked about Kuwhara node. Informed him it will be installed at some point.
</p>

<p>
Had disturbing meeting with Dale. He was quite rude.
</p>

<p>
I came up with a plan to have two environment - one for ingested FB shots, and one for other (future shots).
</p>

<div id="ingested scenes"><h1 id="ingested scenes" class="header"><a href="#ingested scenes">ingested scenes</a></h1></div>

<p>
These need gizmos:
I couldn't open Lisa's shot due to 'no Painterly17' present. (Scene opened half empty.)
</p>

<pre sh>
s 2250_5490
setenv NUKE_PATH /home/.nuke/gizmos
nuke &amp;
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Turns out, if I have gizmos on my path, they error out.

<li>
Removed menu.py and init.py

<li>
Shot opens, but all gizmos have been disabled.

</ul>
<p>
I tried removing expressions from the Painterly and they seemed to 'not' error, but script still didn't open.
