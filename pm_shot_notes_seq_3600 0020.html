Thanks, Rob!
* Can you add the glow up to the crowds that Ian did in shot 81?
* I think the chars could use some cool atmo on them throughout.
* I think bringing up their fills a bit would be good, too  I think we have room, and we want to read sokka's butt in the middle.
* spirit God could use some too, a bit more than the chars.
* It would be nice to use our old friend Noise to get some color variation and value complexity into the big snow/ice wave.
* I think the usual cool atmo glow on the horizon like you did in 120 would be good.

* This 2d FX ground is pretty plain.
    * It's kind of sad compared to the painted ground.
    * I guess it's a snow pile.
    * Well, for now let's integrate them a little better, and leave it.
