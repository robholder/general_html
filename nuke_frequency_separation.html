<div id="Frequency Separation"><h1 id="Frequency Separation" class="header"><a href="#Frequency Separation">Frequency Separation</a></h1></div>

<p>
Frequency separation is a technique that lets you work on the coarse tonal and color information (low frequencies) separately from the fine details and texture (high frequencies). In Nuke, you can achieve this by splitting your image into two layers—a low frequency layer and a high frequency layer—and then operate on each independently before recombining them.
</p>

<p>
Here’s a step‑by‑step breakdown:
</p>

<div id="Frequency Separation-Load Your Image"><h4 id="Load Your Image" class="header"><a href="#Frequency Separation-Load Your Image">Load Your Image</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Load Your Image-Read Node"></span><strong id="Read Node">Read Node</strong>: Begin with a Read node that imports the image you want to work on.

</ul>
<div id="Frequency Separation-Create Two Branches from the Original"><h4 id="Create Two Branches from the Original" class="header"><a href="#Frequency Separation-Create Two Branches from the Original">Create Two Branches from the Original</a></h4></div>

<p>
You need two copies of the image:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
One branch will be processed to generate the low frequency component.

<li>
The other will be used to derive the high frequency component.

</ul>
<p>
To do this in Nuke, duplicate the original image node or simply use multiple nodes reading from the same source.
</p>

<div id="Frequency Separation-Generate the Low Frequency Layer"><h4 id="Generate the Low Frequency Layer" class="header"><a href="#Frequency Separation-Generate the Low Frequency Layer">Generate the Low Frequency Layer</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Generate the Low Frequency Layer-Blur Node (or Gaussian Blur)"></span><strong id="Blur Node (or Gaussian Blur)">Blur Node (or Gaussian Blur)</strong>: Connect a Blur node to one branch of the image. Adjust the blur radius to a value that smooths out the fine details but preserves overall color and tonal transitions. The output of this node is your low frequency layer.

<ul>
<li>
Note: The “ideal” blur radius depends on your image resolution and the characteristics of the details you want to separate.

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Frequency Separation-Extract the High Frequency Layer"><h4 id="Extract the High Frequency Layer" class="header"><a href="#Frequency Separation-Extract the High Frequency Layer">Extract the High Frequency Layer</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Extract the High Frequency Layer-Subtracting the Low Frequency from the Original"></span><strong id="Subtracting the Low Frequency from the Original">Subtracting the Low Frequency from the Original</strong>: To isolate the high frequency details, subtract the low frequency layer (blurred image) from the original image. This can be done in a couple of ways:

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Extract the High Frequency Layer-Merge Node (Operation"></span><strong id="Merge Node (Operation">Merge Node (Operation</strong>: Minus/Difference): Use a Merge node with the operation set to “minus” or “difference.”

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Extract the High Frequency Layer-Input A (Foreground)"></span><strong id="Input A (Foreground)">Input A (Foreground)</strong>: The original image.

<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Extract the High Frequency Layer-Input B (Background)"></span><strong id="Input B (Background)">Input B (Background)</strong>: The blurred image from the previous step.
    The result is a layer that predominantly contains the high frequency information (details, textures, edges) because it represents what’s left after removing the broad tonal and color variations.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Extract the High Frequency Layer-Alternative – Expression or Subtract Node"></span><strong id="Alternative – Expression or Subtract Node">Alternative – Expression or Subtract Node</strong>: If available, you can also subtract one layer from the other using an Expression node configured to compute something like:
<pre plaintext>
high = original - blur
</pre>

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
This mathematically isolates the high frequencies.
</p>

<p>
Now that you have the two components:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Manipulate Each Layer Independently-Low Frequency Adjustments"></span><strong id="Low Frequency Adjustments">Low Frequency Adjustments</strong>: You can apply color corrections, blur out imperfections, or adjust tone using Grade, ColorCorrect, or similar nodes.

<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Manipulate Each Layer Independently-High Frequency Adjustments"></span><strong id="High Frequency Adjustments">High Frequency Adjustments</strong>: Focus on refining textures—this might include reducing skin blemishes in a portrait or emphasized detail adjustments—using tools that target sharpness or detail enhancement.

</ul>
<div id="Frequency Separation-Manipulate Each Layer Independently-Recombine the Layers"><h4 id="Recombine the Layers" class="header"><a href="#Frequency Separation-Manipulate Each Layer Independently-Recombine the Layers">Recombine the Layers</a></h4></div>

<p>
Once you’ve performed the necessary edits on each frequency band:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Manipulate Each Layer Independently-Recombine the Layers-Merge Node (Operation"></span><strong id="Merge Node (Operation">Merge Node (Operation</strong>: Plus/Addition): Recombine the low and high frequency layers with a Merge node (set to a plus operation). The operation should ideally reconstruct an image very close to the original, now refined through separate adjustments:
<pre plaintext>
final = low_frequency + high_frequency
</pre>

<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Manipulate Each Layer Independently-Recombine the Layers-Fine-Tuning"></span><strong id="Fine-Tuning">Fine-Tuning</strong>: You may need a final Grade or ColorCorrect node after recombining to balance the composite result.

</ul>
<div id="Frequency Separation-Summary of the Node Tree"><h3 id="Summary of the Node Tree" class="header"><a href="#Frequency Separation-Summary of the Node Tree">Summary of the Node Tree</a></h3></div>

<p>
A simplified node tree for frequency separation might be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Summary of the Node Tree-Read Node"></span><strong id="Read Node">Read Node</strong>: Load source image.

<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Summary of the Node Tree-Branch A"></span><strong id="Branch A">Branch A</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
Blur Node: Create low frequency layer.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Summary of the Node Tree-Branch B"></span><strong id="Branch B">Branch B</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
(Optional: Duplicate original for clarity)

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Summary of the Node Tree-Subtract Branches"></span><strong id="Subtract Branches">Subtract Branches</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
Merge Node (Minus Operation): Original minus blurred image → high frequency layer.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Summary of the Node Tree-Adjustments"></span><strong id="Adjustments">Adjustments</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
Apply corrective nodes separately to the low frequency and high frequency branches.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Summary of the Node Tree-Recombine Layers"></span><strong id="Recombine Layers">Recombine Layers</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
Merge Node (Plus Operation): Combine adjusted low and high frequency layers.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Summary of the Node Tree-Final Output"></span><strong id="Final Output">Final Output</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
Connect to a Viewer or Write node.

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Frequency Separation-Final Thoughts"><h2 id="Final Thoughts" class="header"><a href="#Frequency Separation-Final Thoughts">Final Thoughts</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Final Thoughts-Purpose"></span><strong id="Purpose">Purpose</strong>: This separation lets you apply corrections or creative adjustments without affecting the detailed texture or the general color/tone significantly. For example, you can soften skin tones in the low frequency layer while preserving fine textures in the high frequency layer.

<li>
<span id="Frequency Separation-Final Thoughts-Customization"></span><strong id="Customization">Customization</strong>: The exact blur radius and subtraction method can be adjusted based on the specific image and the effect you’re aiming for.

</ul>
<p>
Using frequency separation in Nuke provides great control over your image, allowing for targeted, non-destructive adjustments—an invaluable technique in both high-end compositing and retouching workflows.

<div id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option"><h1 id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option" class="header"><a href="#Divide &amp; Multiply Option">Divide &amp; Multiply Option</a></h1></div>

<p>
You can perform frequency separation using a divide/multiply approach instead of the more common subtract/add method—but the two methods represent different ways of conceptualizing and treating detail, and they behave differently under certain conditions. Here’s a breakdown of the differences:

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-Subtractive Frequency Separation-Characteristics:-Linear Operation"></span><strong id="Linear Operation">Linear Operation</strong>: The method is linear, meaning that details are treated as differences in brightness or color that simply add to the base (low frequencies) to reconstruct the original image.

<li>
<span id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-Subtractive Frequency Separation-Characteristics:-Control Over Detail"></span><strong id="Control Over Detail">Control Over Detail</strong>: You can manipulate the high frequency layer (for retouching, smoothing, or sharpening) independently before adding it back.

<li>
<span id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-Subtractive Frequency Separation-Characteristics:-Simplicity"></span><strong id="Simplicity">Simplicity</strong>: This is the most common method and works well when the image data is well behaved (i.e., no very dark regions causing issues).

<li>
<span id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-Multiplicative Frequency Separation (Divide/Multiply)-Workflow:-High Frequency Layer"></span><strong id="High Frequency Layer">High Frequency Layer</strong>: However, rather than subtracting, you calculate the detail as a ratio: <code>Detail = Original/Low</code> (with appropriate safeguards to avoid division by zero—such as clamping low values).

The detail layer scales the low-frequency base rather than simply adding an offset.

<li>
<span id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-Multiplicative Frequency Separation (Divide/Multiply)-Characteristics:-Relative Contrast Preservation"></span><strong id="Relative Contrast Preservation">Relative Contrast Preservation</strong>: This method can sometimes better preserve the relative contrast of an image, especially when the image contains very dark or very bright areas. The ratio (or “gain”) provided by the detail layer can be adjusted to effectively enhance or reduce texture without shifting the overall tone significantly.

<li>
<span id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-Multiplicative Frequency Separation (Divide/Multiply)-Characteristics:-Potential Instability"></span><strong id="Potential Instability">Potential Instability</strong>: One has to be careful that the low-frequency values aren’t too close to zero—otherwise the division can introduce artifacts or noise. It often requires extra clamping or normalization.

</ul>
<div id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-When to Use Which?"><h2 id="When to Use Which?" class="header"><a href="#Divide &amp; Multiply Option-When to Use Which?">When to Use Which?</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-When to Use Which?-Subtractive (Additive) Method"></span><strong id="Subtractive (Additive) Method">Subtractive (Additive) Method</strong>: This is the most straightforward method and works well for many typical retouching tasks—especially when you’re working in a linear space where differences are naturally additive.

<li>
<span id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-When to Use Which?-Divisive (Multiplicative) Method"></span><strong id="Divisive (Multiplicative) Method">Divisive (Multiplicative) Method</strong>: This is common in workflows where maintaining relative contrast is important and where you may want to treat the detail as a modulation factor of the base tone. It’s sometimes seen in photographic or skin retouching techniques where a “texture” layer is blended back via multiplication.

</ul>
<div id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-Summary"><h2 id="Summary" class="header"><a href="#Divide &amp; Multiply Option-Summary">Summary</a></h2></div>

<li>
<span id="Divide &amp; Multiply Option-Summary-Division &amp; Multiplication"></span><strong id="Division &amp; Multiplication">Division &amp; Multiplication</strong>: High = Original/Blur Final = Blur × High

</ul>
<p>
Each method assumes a different model for how the image is constructed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The additive method views detail as an additive “offset.”

<li>
The multiplicative method treats detail as a relative multiplier on the base tones.

</ul>
<p>
In Nuke, both approaches can be implemented using appropriate nodes (like Blur, Merge, Expression, or custom Gizmos), and the choice depends on the specific look you’re aiming for and how your image data behaves.
