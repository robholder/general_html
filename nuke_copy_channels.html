<p>
Can you compare and contrast the three nodes (which have a shuffle/copy functionality) in this list:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Shuffle

<li>
Copy

<li>
Merge (set to 'copy' operation)

</ol>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-ANSWER"><h2 id="ANSWER" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-ANSWER">ANSWER</a></h2></div>

<p>
These three nodes overlap in purpose but behave differently in important ways. Once you understand their personalities, you’ll know exactly when to reach for each one.
</p>

<p>
Below is a clear, practical comparison that matches how compositors actually use them in production.

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-1. Shuffle Node"><h2 id="1. Shuffle Node" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-1. Shuffle Node">1. Shuffle Node</a></h2></div>

<p>
🧠 What it does
</p>

<p>
Shuffle is the most flexible channel‑remapping tool in Nuke. It lets you take any channel from the input and map it to any output channel.
</p>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-1. Shuffle Node-🧩 Key characteristics"><h4 id="🧩 Key characteristics" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-1. Shuffle Node-🧩 Key characteristics">🧩 Key characteristics</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Can rebuild channels from scratch

<li>
Can rename channels

<li>
Can combine channels (e.g., put red into alpha)

<li>
Can output multiple channels at once

<li>
Can create new layers (Shuffle2)

<li>
Does not require two inputs

</ul>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-1. Shuffle Node-🟢 When to use it"><h4 id="🟢 When to use it" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-1. Shuffle Node-🟢 When to use it">🟢 When to use it</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Creating a normals layer from RGB

<li>
Extracting AOVs from a multi‑layer EXR

<li>
Rebuilding alpha from luminance

<li>
Packing channels for a deep or crypto workflow

</ul>

<p>
When you simply want to overwrite a channel in an existing image — Copy is cleaner.
</p>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-2. Copy Node"><h2 id="2. Copy Node" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-2. Copy Node">2. Copy Node</a></h2></div>

<p>
🧠 What it does
</p>

<p>
Copy is a channel‑insertion node. It takes channels from B and overwrites those same channels in A.
</p>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-2. Copy Node-🧩 Key characteristics"><h4 id="🧩 Key characteristics" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-2. Copy Node-🧩 Key characteristics">🧩 Key characteristics</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
A = base image

<li>
B = source of channels

<li>
Only overwrites the channels you specify

<li>
Leaves all other channels in A untouched

<li>
Very predictable and clean

</ul>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-2. Copy Node-🟢 When to use it"><h4 id="🟢 When to use it" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-2. Copy Node-🟢 When to use it">🟢 When to use it</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Adding a roto alpha to a plate

<li>
Injecting motion vectors into a beauty pass

<li>
Replacing a depth channel

<li>
Combining multiple AOVs into one stream

</ul>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-2. Copy Node-🔴 When not to use it"><h4 id="🔴 When not to use it" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-2. Copy Node-🔴 When not to use it">🔴 When not to use it</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
When you need to remap channels (e.g., red → alpha) — Shuffle is better.

<li>
When you need masking or mixing — Merge(copy) is better.

</ul>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-3. Merge Node (operation = copy)"><h2 id="3. Merge Node (operation = copy)" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-3. Merge Node (operation = copy)">3. Merge Node (operation = copy)</a></h2></div>

<p>
🧠 What it does
</p>

<p>
This is essentially a Copy node with extra Merge features.
It still overwrites channels from B into A, but with more control.
</p>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-3. Merge Node (operation = copy)-🧩 Key characteristics"><h4 id="🧩 Key characteristics" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-3. Merge Node (operation = copy)-🧩 Key characteristics">🧩 Key characteristics</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Same channel‑copying behavior as Copy

<li>
Can use a mask input

<li>
Can use mix (opacity of the copy)

<li>
Can be chained with other Merge ops in a consistent pipeline

</ul>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-3. Merge Node (operation = copy)-🟢 When to use it"><h4 id="🟢 When to use it" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-3. Merge Node (operation = copy)-🟢 When to use it">🟢 When to use it</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
You want to copy channels but only in masked areas

<li>
You want to fade the copied channels using the mix knob

<li>
You’re already in a Merge‑heavy comp and want consistency

</ul>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-3. Merge Node (operation = copy)-🔴 When not to use it"><h4 id="🔴 When not to use it" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-3. Merge Node (operation = copy)-🔴 When not to use it">🔴 When not to use it</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
When you want a clean, simple channel overwrite — Copy is clearer

<li>
When you need channel remapping — Shuffle is the right tool

</ul>

<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-🧠 How to choose the right one"><h2 id="🧠 How to choose the right one" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-🧠 How to choose the right one">🧠 How to choose the right one</a></h2></div>

<p>
✔️ Use Shuffle when:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You’re rebuilding or rearranging channels

<li>
You need to extract or repack AOVs

<li>
You want total control over channel mapping

</ul>

<p>
✔️ Use Copy when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You want to insert or replace specific channels

<li>
You want the simplest, cleanest node for channel injection

</ul>

<p>
✔️ Use Merge(copy) when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You want Copy behavior plus masks or mix

<li>
You want to blend or limit the copied channels

</ul>


<div id="Copying Channels - Three Nodes-🎬 Final analogy"><h2 id="🎬 Final analogy" class="header"><a href="#Copying Channels - Three Nodes-🎬 Final analogy">🎬 Final analogy</a></h2></div>

<p>
Think of them like tools in a workshop:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Shuffle = a full channel router — you can wire anything to anything

<li>
Copy = a precise channel‑replacement tool — clean and surgical

</ul>

<p>
Merge(copy) = Copy with a dimmer switch and a stencil — more control when needed
