Here is a concise summary of common chmod commands using the numeric (octal) mode to set useful file permission states.

<p>
To set the permissions, use the chmod command followed by the numeric code and the filename (or directory name).
</p>

<div id="chmod-Concise Instructions for Setting Permissions-For Standard Files (No Execution Needed)"><h4 id="For Standard Files (No Execution Needed)" class="header"><a href="#chmod-Concise Instructions for Setting Permissions-For Standard Files (No Execution Needed)">For Standard Files (No Execution Needed)</a></h4></div>

<p>
To allow the owner to read and write, and everyone else to just read:
</p>

<pre bash>
chmod 644 filename
</pre>

<div id="chmod-Concise Instructions for Setting Permissions-For Private Files"><h4 id="For Private Files" class="header"><a href="#chmod-Concise Instructions for Setting Permissions-For Private Files">For Private Files</a></h4></div>

<p>
To allow only the owner to read and write:
</p>

<pre bash>
chmod 600 filename
</pre>

<div id="chmod-Concise Instructions for Setting Permissions-For Scripts or Directories (Execution/Access Needed)"><h4 id="For Scripts or Directories (Execution/Access Needed)" class="header"><a href="#chmod-Concise Instructions for Setting Permissions-For Scripts or Directories (Execution/Access Needed)">For Scripts or Directories (Execution/Access Needed)</a></h4></div>

<p>
To allow the owner full control, and everyone else to read and execute (crucial for accessing a directory's contents):
</p>

<pre bash>
chmod 755 script_or_directory
</pre>

<p>
As a supplemental step for critical files, use chattr to prevent even the root user from deleting the file. This is a file attribute, not a permission:
</p>

<pre bash>
sudo chattr +i filename
</pre>
<p>
(The file must be mutable for the command to succeed.)
</p>

<div id="chmod-System Admin Impact (or Will it cause problems?)"><h2 id="System Admin Impact (or Will it cause problems?)" class="header"><a href="#chmod-System Admin Impact (or Will it cause problems?)">System Admin Impact (or Will it cause problems?)</a></h2></div>

<p>
If you set a file to read-only (e.g., using chmod 444), system administrators can generally still delete it as part of their day-to-day duties. You won't cause problems with their regular cleanup or admin tasks.
</p>

<p>
Here's why:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Permissions to Delete: The ability to delete a file is governed by the Write (w) and Execute (x) permissions on the directory that contains the file, not the file itself. By making the file read-only (444), you only prevent modifications to its content.

<li>
The Root Override: Since system administrators operate as the root user (or with sudo), they have the power to override standard file permissions. Even if the containing directory somehow restricted deletion, a sysadmin could simply:

<ul>
<li>
Temporarily change the directory permissions.

<li>
Change the file permissions (e.g., from 444 back to 644).

<li>
Delete the file.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
In short, setting a file to read-only using chmod provides a basic level of protection against accidental modification by non-root users, but it is not a barrier to deletion by a system administrator. This is standard and expected behavior in Linux/Unix environments.
