* [✗] The horns are supposed to have a grad on them instead of the hard line.  You can see it in the style guide above.
* [✓] What a massively wide arrow, haha.
    * Me:I could edit that relatively easily - it's virtually a still image.
    * Dale: I think that would be very good to do.
* [✓] Jake will want more atmo on the bg rocks.
* [✓] The tongue darker in the fill will help. (frame 1011)
* Have a look at Terry's shot 30 for colors on the nose, tongue and neck fur. 
    * Actually, DON'T do that.  I think the colors in that are wrong.
* [✓] The nose colors are good, but the neck fur colors are not right.
    * These colors are wrong. Yours are better.

 * Horns: gradient instead of hard line of color change
* More atmo on floating rocks (and horizon)
* Tongue darker in the fill (and adjusted in the key closer to shot 30)
* Nose color adjusted closer to shot 30
* Adjusted width of Aang's arrow (head)

<ul>
<li>
The background should be more lifted to pop out Gorillavark pop.

<li>
Chars can drop down in brightness.

<li>
Shadows should be warm on the character side. Green on front, reddish on back.

</ul>

* [✓] I don't think the gradient on the horns is quite working yet.  I see a hard line and think the blue should be lower.
    * (Look at shot 30)
* [✓] We have atmo/bounce on him from below.  I think we also need distance atmo on him on his head and upper torso.  He's about 100 feet tall, so we should put a vertical distance grad on him when he's standing 
* FG chars:
    * [✗] Red fills (the backs of the chars)
    * [✗] Green rims (at the front of the chars - on they're faces)

3600_0095 v11
* Background (sky &amp; aurora) lifted to contrast more against creature
* More atmo on floating rocks
* Horn grads adjusted
* Added some vertical atmo on creature (as he stands tall at head of shot)
* Characters:
    * Reds in shadow side (rear) and shadow side dropped in value
    * Greens in rims (front)

Sorry about the slow response, Rob.
This looks good!
* For the sky, I think we've gone a tad too bright and desat in this part.
    * [✓] I think we want to go a bit darker and more saturated.
    * [✓] I think we have some room while keeping the good staging on him.
And this will fit better with the rest of the sequence.  Thanks!
