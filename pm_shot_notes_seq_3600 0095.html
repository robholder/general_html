* [✗] The horns are supposed to have a grad on them instead of the hard line.  You can see it in the style guide above.
* [✓] What a massively wide arrow, haha.
    * Me:I could edit that relatively easily - it's virtually a still image.
    * Dale: I think that would be very good to do.
* [✓] Jake will want more atmo on the bg rocks.
* [✓] The tongue darker in the fill will help. (frame 1011)
* Have a look at Terry's shot 30 for colors on the nose, tongue and neck fur. 
    * Actually, DON'T do that.  I think the colors in that are wrong.
* [✓] The nose colors are good, but the neck fur colors are not right.
    * These colors are wrong. Yours are better.

 * Horns: gradient instead of hard line of color change
* More atmo on floating rocks (and horizon)
* Tongue darker in the fill (and adjusted in the key closer to shot 30)
* Nose color adjusted closer to shot 30
* Adjusted width of Aang's arrow (head)

<ul>
<li>
The background should be more lifted to pop out Gorillavark pop.

<li>
Chars can drop down in brightness.

<li>
Shadows should be warm on the character side. Green on front, reddish on back.

</ul>

* [✓] I don't think the gradient on the horns is quite working yet.  I see a hard line and think the blue should be lower.
    * (Look at shot 30)
* [✓] We have atmo/bounce on him from below.  I think we also need distance atmo on him on his head and upper torso.  He's about 100 feet tall, so we should put a vertical distance grad on him when he's standing 
* FG chars:
    * [✗] Red fills (the backs of the chars)
    * [✗] Green rims (at the front of the chars - on they're faces)

* Background (sky &amp; aurora) lifted to contrast more against creature
* More atmo on floating rocks
* Horn grads adjusted
* Added some vertical atmo on creature (as he stands tall at head of shot)
* Characters:
    * Reds in shadow side (rear) and shadow side dropped in value
    * Greens in rims (front)

Sorry about the slow response, Rob.
This looks good!
* For the sky, I think we've gone a tad too bright and desat in this part.
    * [✓] I think we want to go a bit darker and more saturated.
    * [✓] I think we have some room while keeping the good staging on him.
And this will fit better with the rest of the sequence.  Thanks!

Official notes:
</p>

<p>
3600_0095_comp_v12 – Rob H – First Review
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The rocks at the top of the shot feel inverse value wise. They should be darker value than the sky behind them. Add more pink atmosphere behind the rocks and darken the rocks.

<li>
There are some straight diagonal lines on the right side of frame. Blur those so they don’t feel as sharp. There is one on the left as well.

<li>
Put the crowds behind the rocks.

<li>
Upper left feels busy and bright compared to the other sections. Push those back in atmo. Knock down the brights on the crowds as well.

</ul>
<p>
Dale to take for approval. Approved with notes!
</p>

Hey, everyone!
I'm reposting this.
Please take note that gorillavark's snout is the same yellowish color as his eyelids.
We'll have to go back and fix it in continuity where it's pink, like in shot 46.
This is not a request to go back into finalled shots unless you are working on TC notes for them.
Going forward, you can look at this style guide or look at shot 81 for snout color.
Thank you!
 

PS:  It was painted both pink and yellow in the keys.  :i_shrug:
Please note the above, @Rob Holder

UPDATE!
I've asked Jake and Aaron to give me the definitive answer on snout color.
Maybe he has snout color changing powers.

Looks good, Rob!
Changes are all working.
* [✓] Could you put the crowds on 2s?
* [✓] And we've got some shimmering persimmons on scr rt.
    * putting on hold for now - but added some blur.
This is more of a Tech note, but it would be nice if we had a solve for this.
I'm not sure what it is.  I'm going to check with Jerry if we can render the crowds at 4k.

I haven't addressed the shimmering persimmons. Awaiting consensus.
