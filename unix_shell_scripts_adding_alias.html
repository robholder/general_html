<div id="Adding Alias to User's .zshrc-Question"><h2 id="Question" class="header"><a href="#Adding Alias to User's .zshrc-Question">Question</a></h2></div>

<p>
I want to inject an alias line into a User's .zshrc as part of a shell_script.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Check to see if .zshrc exists

<li>
Give the user an opportunity to reject .zshrc creation.

<li>
I want to check if the alias line is already in the .zshrc to prevent 'doubling up'.

<li>
I want to allow the user accept or reject.

<li>
Add a backup or undo option.

</ol>

<pre bash>
#!/bin/bash

# Define the alias command
ALIAS_CMD='alias sme="source $HOME/scripts/script_to_source.sh"'
ZSHRC_FILE="$HOME/.zshrc"
BACKUP_FILE="$HOME/.zshrc.bak"

# Check if alias already exists
if grep -Fxq "$ALIAS_CMD" "$ZSHRC_FILE"; then
    echo "Alias already exists in .zshrc. No changes made."
    exit 0
fi

# Check if .zshrc exists; if not, prompt the user before creating it
if [[ ! -f "$ZSHRC_FILE" ]]; then
    echo ".zshrc does not exist."
    read -p "Would you like to create a new .zshrc file? (y/n): " create_choice
    if [[ "$create_choice" != "y" ]]; then
        echo "Operation canceled. Alias was NOT added."
        exit 0
    fi
    echo "# Created .zshrc file for user" &gt; "$ZSHRC_FILE"
    echo ".zshrc file has been created."
fi

# Create a backup before modifying .zshrc
cp "$ZSHRC_FILE" "$BACKUP_FILE"
echo "Backup created: $BACKUP_FILE"

# Ask user for confirmation before adding alias
echo "The following alias will be added to your .zshrc:"
echo "$ALIAS_CMD"
read -p "Do you want to proceed? (y/n): " alias_choice

if [[ "$alias_choice" == "y" ]]; then
    echo "$ALIAS_CMD" &gt;&gt; "$ZSHRC_FILE"
    echo "Alias successfully added to .zshrc!"
    echo "Run 'source ~/.zshrc' to apply changes."

    # Ask if user wants an undo option
    read -p "Would you like to keep the backup or restore it? (keep/undo): " undo_choice
    if [[ "$undo_choice" == "undo" ]]; then
        mv "$BACKUP_FILE" "$ZSHRC_FILE"
        echo "Undo completed. .zshrc has been restored."
    else
        echo "Backup kept as $BACKUP_FILE."
    fi
else
    echo "Operation canceled. Alias was NOT added."

<div id="Adding Alias to User's .zshrc-Question-How It Works"><h3 id="How It Works" class="header"><a href="#Adding Alias to User's .zshrc-Question-How It Works">How It Works</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
✔ If .zshrc doesn’t exist, the user gets the option to create it. 

<li>
✔ If .zshrc exists and doesn’t contain the alias, the user is asked before adding it. 

<li>
✔ If the alias already exists, the script exits without prompting the user.

</ul>

<div id="Adding Alias to User's .zshrc-Question-How Undo Works"><h3 id="How Undo Works" class="header"><a href="#Adding Alias to User's .zshrc-Question-How Undo Works">How Undo Works</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
✔ Before modifying .zshrc, a backup is created (cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.bak). 

<li>
✔ After adding the alias, the user is asked if they want to undo. 

<li>
✔ If they choose undo, the script restores the backup and removes the changes. 

<li>
✔ If they choose to keep the backup, it remains saved for future undo.

</ul>

<div id="Adding Alias to User's .zshrc-Question-How Undo Works-Using Undo Manually Later"><h4 id="Using Undo Manually Later" class="header"><a href="#Adding Alias to User's .zshrc-Question-How Undo Works-Using Undo Manually Later">Using Undo Manually Later</a></h4></div>

<p>
If the user doesn't undo immediately but wants to later, they can run:
</p>

<pre sh>
mv ~/.zshrc.bak ~/.zshrc
echo "Changes reverted!"
</pre>
