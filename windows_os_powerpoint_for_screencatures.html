<p>
If you want to create an animated screencapture, you can use Powerpoint on Windows OS (and record a remote session's window via the windows host).
</p>

<div id="Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-Open Powerpoint"><h4 id="Open Powerpoint" class="header"><a href="#Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-Open Powerpoint">Open Powerpoint</a></h4></div>

<p>
In Windows Start Menu:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Open Powerpoint:

<ul>
<li>
Double click on 'Blank presentation'

<li>
Delete the 'Click to add title' and 'Click to add subtitle':

<ul>
<li>
Drag across the two items to select

<li>
Hit the delete key

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-Capture the screen as a video:"><h4 id="Capture the screen as a video:" class="header"><a href="#Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-Capture the screen as a video:">Capture the screen as a video:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Click on either:

<ul>
<li>
Insert menu

<li>
Record menu

</ul>
<li>
Click on 'Screen Recording'

<li>
Select area of screen (smaller being better of course)

<li>
Controls should appear at the top of the active monitor

<ul>
<li>
Switch audio on or off

<li>
Switch cursor on or off

</ul>
<li>
Click 'Record'

<ul>
<li>
(The controls will disappear)

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-Completion of Recording"><h4 id="Completion of Recording" class="header"><a href="#Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-Completion of Recording">Completion of Recording</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
At completion of capture

<ul>
<li>
Move cursor to the top of the screen to re-activate the record controls.

<ul>
<li>
Click on the Stop icon

<li>
or

<li>
'Windows Key + Shift + Q'

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
The capture will be placed onto your Powerpoint slide.
</p>

<div id="Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-Create an MP4"><h3 id="Create an MP4" class="header"><a href="#Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-Create an MP4">Create an MP4</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
To save as an MP4, just right click on your media/video item and choose:

<ul>
<li>
Save media as..

</ul>
<li>
The MP4 video file is ready.

</ul>

<div id="Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-GIF"><h3 id="GIF" class="header"><a href="#Creating an Animated GIF of a Screencapture on Windows-GIF">GIF</a></h3></div>

<p>
To create a GIF, you have to export the whole 'slide'.
</p>

<p>
It's likely your slide is bigger than the capture (or smaller), so to prepare the slide format:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you click on the capture video element,  you'll see its properties under the Video Format menu tool bar.

<li>
The size will be in inches. Make a note of the size

<li>
Go to the Design menu and click on:

<ul>
<li>
Slide Size &gt; Custom Slide Size...

<li>
Enter the size of the catured video.

<li>
If correct the video should sit snugly on the slide.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
To export the GIF:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Click on File menu (don't panic that your stuff has disappeared, it's still there if you click the left arrow in a circle.

<li>
Select 'Export'

<li>
Click on Create an Animated GIF

<ul>
<li>
Choose a size/quality (I liked 720 at 15fps in terms of compression/size)

<li>
Click on 'Create GIF'

</ul>
<li>
Save somewhere that you'll remember!!

</ul>
<p>
It'll take a while too 'cook': if you check it too soon, you'll get a Windows warning (something like, 'open in another window' or something).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Just wait!

<li>
Eventually, you'll be able to open and see it in its full glory.

</ul>

<p>
Post your video somewhere and glow with pride.
