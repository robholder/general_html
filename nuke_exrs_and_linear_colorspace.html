<div id="EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?"><h1 id="EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?" class="header"><a href="#EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?">EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?</a></h1></div>

<p>
In most workflows—and especially in high-end compositing and visual effects—the recommended practice is to save EXR images in a linear (scene-linear) color space. Here’s why and how you determine the right setting:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?-Preservation of Data"></span><strong id="Preservation of Data">Preservation of Data</strong>: EXR is designed to handle high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging. Saving data in linear space preserves the full range of luminance values without any gamma correction applied. This makes sure you don’t bake in any non‑linear transformations that can limit the image’s editing latitude.

<li>
<span id="EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?-Accurate Compositing"></span><strong id="Accurate Compositing">Accurate Compositing</strong>: Compositing operations (like blending, color correction, and filtering) assume that the image data represents actual light intensities—i.e., they’re linear. When your data is linear, mathematical operations (such as addition, multiplication, and blending) behave predictably. This avoids artifacts that can arise if the data were stored in a gamma‑encoded space.

<li>
<span id="EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?-Pipeline Consistency"></span><strong id="Pipeline Consistency">Pipeline Consistency</strong>: Typically, the working space in production pipelines is linear (or scene linear) because it provides a clean slate for subsequent grading and effects. Even if your final deliverable is in a different color space (like Rec.709), you would perform that conversion as a last step rather than storing your intermediary images in a non‑linear space.

<li>
<span id="EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?-Exceptions"></span><strong id="Exceptions">Exceptions</strong>: While linear is by far the most common choice, some specialized pipelines might intentionally use a different encoding if it’s dictated by a specific workflow or display requirement. However, for most jobs—especially those involving compositing in Nuke—it’s best to stick with linear.

</ul>

<div id="EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?-In summary:"><h3 id="In summary:" class="header"><a href="#EXRs - Always Linear Colorspace?-In summary:">In summary:</a></h3></div>

<p>
EXR images should almost always be saved using a linear color space to ensure proper data integrity and predictable compositing behavior. If your final output demands a non‑linear display (such as for client dailies or broadcast), you would apply the necessary transforms at the final output stage rather than embedding them in your EXRs.
</p>
 
<div id="Intermediate vs Final Output"><h1 id="Intermediate vs Final Output" class="header"><a href="#Intermediate vs Final Output">Intermediate vs Final Output</a></h1></div>

<p>
In many pipelines EXR files are used as high‑quality, linear intermediate files. For the final output, though, you'll typically want to convert the linear EXRs into a file format and color space that match your show or client’s delivery requirements. Here’s how that usually breaks down:
</p>

<div id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Intermediate vs. Final Output"><h2 id="Intermediate vs. Final Output" class="header"><a href="#Intermediate vs Final Output-Intermediate vs. Final Output">Intermediate vs. Final Output</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Intermediate vs. Final Output-Intermediate Files (EXR)"></span><strong id="Intermediate Files (EXR)">Intermediate Files (EXR)</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
Purpose: Preserve maximum dynamic range, quality, and flexibility for compositing in a linear (scene‑linear) workflow.

<li>
Format: OpenEXR files in linear space are standard due to their high-bit depth and support for multi‑channel data.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Intermediate vs. Final Output-Final Output Files"></span><strong id="Final Output Files">Final Output Files</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
Purpose: Deliver the final look to the audience with the correct tone mapping or gamma encoding for display.

<li>
Process: Typically, you take your linear comp (your EXR sequence) and apply a color transform or LUT that converts the linear data into the desired output color space (such as Rec.709, DCI‑P3, or another target).

<li>
Format: Based on the delivery requirements, you might generate a final QuickTime file with ProRes, a DPX sequence, or another file type that embeds these non‑linear adjustments.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?"><h2 id="Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?" class="header"><a href="#Intermediate vs Final Output-Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?">Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?-Display Characteristics"></span><strong id="Display Characteristics">Display Characteristics</strong>: Most monitors and consumer devices expect images encoded with a gamma curve (non‑linear). For example, Rec.709 applies a gamma of about 2.4, which is very different from the linear space used during compositing.

<li>
<span id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?-Technical Requirements"></span><strong id="Technical Requirements">Technical Requirements</strong>: Deliverables for broadcast, streaming, or cinema screenings typically have strict color space and file format requirements to ensure consistency of look and compatibility with playback systems. This is why you render out your final master in a file format that conforms to these standards.

<li>
<span id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?-Workflow Example"></span><strong id="Workflow Example">Workflow Example</strong>:

<ul>
<li>
Composite &amp; Grade in EXRs: Work in linear space using your high‑quality OpenEXRs.

<li>
Apply a Lookup Transform: At the end of the node tree (or in a dedicated export stage), use a node (like a OCIO ColorSpace node or a Grade node with a LUT) to convert your linear data to Rec.709 (or your target output space).

<li>
Render Final Output: Write out the transformed images as your final deliverable in a format suited to the project's needs, such as a QuickTime ProRes file or a DPX sequence.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?-In Summary"><h3 id="In Summary" class="header"><a href="#Intermediate vs Final Output-Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?-In Summary">In Summary</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?-In Summary-Intermediate"></span><strong id="Intermediate">Intermediate</strong>: Use linear EXR files for retaining quality and flexibility in compositing.

<li>
<span id="Intermediate vs Final Output-Why Switch Formats and Color Spaces?-In Summary-Final Output"></span><strong id="Final Output">Final Output</strong>: Convert that linear data to a non‑linear color space that matches the intended display (often in a different file format) so that your image looks correct on the target device.

</ul>

<p>
So final output generally demands an alternative file format and often a non‑linear color space, ensuring the preview on deliverable media closely matches your creative vision.

<div id="Delivery Formats"><h1 id="Delivery Formats" class="header"><a href="#Delivery Formats">Delivery Formats</a></h1></div>

<p>
When the final output is delivered to a client or broadcaster, the ideal format depends on where and how the content will be viewed. Here’s a breakdown of some common output formats tailored to different specific delivery scenarios:
</p>

<div id="Delivery Formats-Theatrical (Cinema) Deliverables"><h2 id="Theatrical (Cinema) Deliverables" class="header"><a href="#Delivery Formats-Theatrical (Cinema) Deliverables">Theatrical (Cinema) Deliverables</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-Theatrical (Cinema) Deliverables-DPX Sequences"></span><strong id="DPX Sequences">DPX Sequences</strong>: DPX is a standard in the film industry. It offers high-bit-depth, lossless quality that’s ideal for large-screen projection and archival. A DPX sequence retains everything from the original grade, making it suitable for film scanning and digital cinema packaging.

<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-Theatrical (Cinema) Deliverables-Digital Cinema Package (DCP)"></span><strong id="Digital Cinema Package (DCP)">Digital Cinema Package (DCP)</strong>: While DCPs themselves aren’t written directly in Nuke, the graded master might be converted into a DCP later in the pipeline. DCPs follow strict standards (often using JPEG2000 compression) to ensure consistent theater projection.

</ul>

<div id="Delivery Formats-Broadcast and Television"><h2 id="Broadcast and Television" class="header"><a href="#Delivery Formats-Broadcast and Television">Broadcast and Television</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-Broadcast and Television-QuickTime with ProRes (422, 4444)"></span><strong id="QuickTime with ProRes (422, 4444)">QuickTime with ProRes (422, 4444)</strong>: For broadcast TV, QuickTime files encoded with Apple ProRes are very common. They offer high quality while keeping file sizes manageable. Rec.709 is typically the color space used for broadcast, so you’d ensure your final grade is transformed accordingly.

<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-Broadcast and Television-MXF with DNxHD/DNxHR"></span><strong id="MXF with DNxHD/DNxHR">MXF with DNxHD/DNxHR</strong>: For broadcast environments that favor MXF containers, DNxHD (for HD content) or DNxHR (for higher resolutions) are widely adopted. They provide robust, high-quality compression that meets broadcast standards.

</ul>

<div id="Delivery Formats-Online Streaming and Web Content"><h2 id="Online Streaming and Web Content" class="header"><a href="#Delivery Formats-Online Streaming and Web Content">Online Streaming and Web Content</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-Online Streaming and Web Content-MP4/MOV with H.264 or H.265"></span><strong id="MP4/MOV with H.264 or H.265">MP4/MOV with H.264 or H.265</strong>: Final deliverables for online streaming are usually highly compressed using codecs like H.264 (or increasingly H.265 for higher efficiency). These files often come in an MP4 or MOV container, and the final grade is typically converted to Rec.709 (or BT.709) unless a wider gamut is required.

<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-Online Streaming and Web Content-Adaptive Streaming Formats"></span><strong id="Adaptive Streaming Formats">Adaptive Streaming Formats</strong>: In some cases, files might be transcoded into multiple bitrates for adaptive streaming delivery (e.g., HLS or DASH workflows).

</ul>

<div id="Delivery Formats-Review/Dailies and Internally Used Formats"><h2 id="Review/Dailies and Internally Used Formats" class="header"><a href="#Delivery Formats-Review/Dailies and Internally Used Formats">Review/Dailies and Internally Used Formats</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-Review/Dailies and Internally Used Formats-Intermediate EXR Files"></span><strong id="Intermediate EXR Files">Intermediate EXR Files</strong>: While EXR files are generally used as intermediates in a linear space to preserve the full dynamic range during compositing, they’re also used for high-quality dailies before the final transform to a display-referred space.

<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-Review/Dailies and Internally Used Formats-Proxies (Low-Resolution Versions)"></span><strong id="Proxies (Low-Resolution Versions)">Proxies (Low-Resolution Versions)</strong>: For quick review cycles, editors and VFX supervisors might work off lower-resolution proxy files, sometimes in formats like QuickTime with lower-bitrate encodings to speed up turn-around times.

</ul>

<div id="Delivery Formats-How to Choose the Right Output Format"><h2 id="How to Choose the Right Output Format" class="header"><a href="#Delivery Formats-How to Choose the Right Output Format">How to Choose the Right Output Format</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-How to Choose the Right Output Format-Delivery Specifications"></span><strong id="Delivery Specifications">Delivery Specifications</strong>: Always consult the project brief or client's delivery guidelines. If the client or broadcaster specifies DPX for film or MXF for TV, those become your targets.

<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-How to Choose the Right Output Format-Quality vs. File Size"></span><strong id="Quality vs. File Size">Quality vs. File Size</strong>: High-quality formats like DPX or ProRes are used when image integrity is paramount. For web streaming, however, more heavily compressed formats like H.264 are acceptable due to bandwidth limitations.

<li>
<span id="Delivery Formats-How to Choose the Right Output Format-Color Space Considerations"></span><strong id="Color Space Considerations">Color Space Considerations</strong>: Regardless of the file container, it’s essential to perform your final color transform (e.g., from linear or ACES to Rec.709) as the last step in your comp, so that the delivered file matches the intended viewing conditions.

</ul>

<p>
In essence, while EXRs are great for maintaining quality in the production process, final deliverables usually require converting the graded linear comp into a format and color space optimized for the target display—DPX/DCP for cinema, ProRes/MXF for broadcast, and H.264/H.265 for streaming.
