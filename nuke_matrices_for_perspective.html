There are two distinct uses of the term "projection", and it can get confusing.
</p>

<div id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-Geometric (or Perspective) Projection:"><h4 id="Geometric (or Perspective) Projection:" class="header"><a href="#Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-Geometric (or Perspective) Projection:">Geometric (or Perspective) Projection:</a></h4></div>

<p>
This is the classic computer graphics concept where 3D points are projected onto a 2D screen. In this case, you use a perspective transformation matrix to simulate how a camera sees the world. The math handles how objects shrink with distance, how lines converge, and creates a realistic sense of depth. This is what's behind the "projection" in a camera, and the articles you mentioned focus on that process.
</p>

<div id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-Texture Projection:"><h4 id="Texture Projection:" class="header"><a href="#Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-Texture Projection:">Texture Projection:</a></h4></div>
<p>
This is what you're envisioning for virtual set extensions or adding details to surfaces. Here, an image (or texture) is "projected" onto a 3D geometry—much like shining a slide projector onto a wall. The process aligns the image with the surface of the geometry using a projection from a camera or projector-like node (e.g., Nuke’s Project3D node). While this process also relies on perspective mathematics (so that the texture maps correctly from the camera's viewpoint), the goal is different: you're not transforming geometry to create a 2D image, you're mapping an image onto a surface.

<p>
Even in texture projection, a perspective matrix can be beneficial. For example, if your real-world shot has slight distortions or if the geometry isn’t perfectly aligned with the camera’s perspective, you might need to tweak the projection. A custom perspective matrix lets you:

</ul>

<p>
In summary, while both processes involve concepts of perspective, one is about mapping 3D geometry to a 2D image (the camera projection), and the other is about mapping an image onto a 3D surface (texture projection). The matrix transforms common to both can be tweaked to achieve the desired alignment and depth effects, especially when the standard camera settings don’t perfectly match the needs of your composite.

Let's walk through a concrete example where projecting a texture onto geometry benefits from a perspective matrix tweak—and how you’d set that up in Nuke.
</p>

<div id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-Scenario: Extending a Building Facade"><h2 id="Scenario: Extending a Building Facade" class="header"><a href="#Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-Scenario: Extending a Building Facade">Scenario: Extending a Building Facade</a></h2></div>

<p>
Imagine you have a live-action plate of a city street where a building’s upper portion wasn’t captured. You want to digitally paint or project a CG extension onto that building’s facade. A basic camera projection with the Project3D node might work fine, but sometimes the look isn’t perfect because:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The projected texture might not perfectly match the way the building tapers in real life.

<li>
Wide-angle cameras or slight lens distortions might cause the texture to appear either too flat or too stretched compared to the natural perspective in the shot.

</ul>

<p>
A perspective matrix transform lets you fine-tune the way the projection behaves, ensuring distant parts of the texture shrink naturally (mimicking the camera’s perspective) and aligning the extension with the existing building.
</p>

</ul>

<p>
In this standard workflow, the texture adheres to the geometry based solely on the camera’s parameters. But if the facade has slight curvature or the original projection is off due to lens characteristics, the extension might not look perfectly natural.
</p>

<p>
This is where the perspective matrix transform comes into play. By inserting a TransformGeo node (or applying a custom matrix in your 3D projection setup), you adjust the geometry’s coordinate mapping to fine-tune the projection. In our scenario, we might need the distant parts of the facade (farther from the camera) to be scaled down a bit more than your basic projection is giving.
</p>

<div id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-Integrating a Perspective Matrix-Why Would Distant Objects Shrink?"><h3 id="Why Would Distant Objects Shrink?" class="header"><a href="#Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-Integrating a Perspective Matrix-Why Would Distant Objects Shrink?">Why Would Distant Objects Shrink?</a></h3></div>
<p>
In natural perspective, objects farther away appear smaller. If you have an extension texture that’s meant to “continue” a building, you want the top (or parts farther from the camera) to compress slightly so that the extension doesn’t appear unnaturally the same scale as the closer parts. By injecting a perspective tweak, the matrix can modify the texture coordinates or geometry positions so that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Closer parts remain unaffected (or minimally adjusted).

<li>
Distant parts shrink subtly, giving a more natural depth appearance.

</ul>

<hr />
</p>

<p>
Yes, that's exactly how it works. When you apply a TransformGeo node with a custom perspective matrix, you're effectively re-mapping the positions of the geometry's points in 3D space. Here's what happens:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-How to Execute It in Nuke-The Benefit in This Setup-Geometry Adjustment:"></span><strong id="Geometry Adjustment:">Geometry Adjustment:</strong> The TransformGeo node multiplies each vertex (or point) of your 3D geometry by your custom 4×4 matrix. This means the coordinates (X, Y, Z) of every point are recalculated. If your matrix introduces perspective distortion—say, by adjusting the homogeneous coordinate or shifting Z values—the points will be "pushed" or "pulled" accordingly. This alters the spatial layout of the geometry.

<li>
<span id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-How to Execute It in Nuke-The Benefit in This Setup-Scanline Renderer Perception:"></span><strong id="Scanline Renderer Perception:">Scanline Renderer Perception:</strong> The ScanlineRender node then takes this transformed geometry and uses it to composite the scene. Because the geometry has been modified by the matrix, the renderer sees and processes a version of the geometry that's been distorted by these new coordinates. Essentially, it's as if you've fine-tuned the scene's spatial arrangements before the rendering happens. The new positions create a modified perspective, which can make distant parts appear smaller or bring certain details into sharper focus.

<li>
<span id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-How to Execute It in Nuke-The Benefit in This Setup-Resulting Texture Projection:"></span><strong id="Resulting Texture Projection:">Resulting Texture Projection:</strong> When you apply texture projection (via Project3D) onto this transformed geometry, the texture gets mapped based on the altered positions. This extra step can help align a projected texture better with the live-action plate by ensuring that the perspective matches any peculiarities or distortions present in the original camera work.

</ul>

<p>
So, to sum it up: Yes, applying a TransformGeo node with a perspective matrix indeed "pushes and pulls" the geometry in 3D space. The ScanlineRender node then renders the scene based on these new positions, effectively adjusting the final visual perspective of your texture projection.
</p>

<p>
Does that help clarify how the transformation affects the scene before rendering?
</p>

<p>
<span id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-How to Execute It in Nuke-The Benefit in This Setup-<em>Yes, that helps.

<hr />
</p>

<p>
Yes, that's exactly right. The order in which you apply the TransformGeo node relative to the texture projection changes what aspect you're adjusting:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-How to Execute It in Nuke-The Benefit in This Setup-Adjusting the &quot;Fit&quot;:"></span><strong id="Adjusting the &quot;Fit&quot;:">Adjusting the "Fit":</strong> If you want to influence how the texture maps onto the underlying geometry—essentially altering the UV or spatial relationship so that the image lines up better with the surface—you'd apply the TransformGeo adjustment before the texture projection is calculated. In this setup, the geometry's positions are modified, and then the Project3D node (or whichever node handles the projection) uses this altered geometry to compute new texture coordinates. This way, the texture "fits" more naturally on the improved geometry.

<li>
<span id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-How to Execute It in Nuke-The Benefit in This Setup-Adjusting the &quot;Look&quot;:"></span><strong id="Adjusting the &quot;Look&quot;:">Adjusting the "Look":</strong> On the other hand, if you want to change the overall aesthetic—like tilting, scaling, or otherwise transforming the already-projected texture on the geometry—you would apply the TransformGeo node after the texture projection. Here, the projection is first computed and the texture is already in place on the geometry. Then, the TransformGeo node modifies the final appearance of that composite, essentially pushing or pulling the already rendered look.

</ul>

<p>
In Nuke, the node order is crucial because each node passes its output downstream. So, by deciding whether to place your TransformGeo node before or after your projection node, you determine whether you're affecting the initial mapping of the texture (the "fit") or the final appearance (the "look").

(Like barreling caused by a lens?)</em>"><em>Is it possible to create curved perspective with the matrix? (Like barreling caused by a lens?)</em></strong>
<hr />
</p>

<p>
That's a great question! The short answer is: not exactly—a standard 4×4 transformation matrix is a linear operator, so it can't directly create the kind of non‑linear curved effects (like barrel distortion) you'd expect from a lens.
</p>

<div id="Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-How to Execute It in Nuke-Why a Standard Matrix Falls Short"><h3 id="Why a Standard Matrix Falls Short" class="header"><a href="#Copilot Conversation - How To Use Matrices In Nuke For Perspective-How to Execute It in Nuke-Why a Standard Matrix Falls Short">Why a Standard Matrix Falls Short</a></h3></div>

<p>
A 4×4 matrix applied in homogeneous coordinates performs linear transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling, shearing, and perspective division. All these operations are linear, which means they preserve straight lines. So, if you apply a linear matrix:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Straight lines remain straight

<li>
Perspective scaling is uniform (based solely on the Z-coordinate and homogeneous division)

</ul>

<p>
Barrel distortion, on the other hand, is a non-linear, radial distortion—it curves lines outward (or inward in pincushion distortion). This radial effect comes from higher-order terms (like quadratic or cubic components) that aren't present in a simple 4×4 matrix.

In scenarios like virtual set extensions or texture projection on surfaces, you might discover that the basic projection looks too “perfect” or “flat” compared to the real-world camera footage. Real camera lenses—especially wide-angle ones—introduce curved distortion. Adjusting the projection with a LensDistortion node (or a similar warp) can help your projected image match the natural lens characteristics, thereby blending more seamlessly with the live-action plate.
