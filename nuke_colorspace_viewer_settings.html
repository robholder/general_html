The Viewer colorspace setting depends entirely on your project’s workflow and delivery requirements. Here’s how to think about and set it up:
</p>

<div id="Match Your Pipeline"><h2 id="Match Your Pipeline" class="header"><a href="#Match Your Pipeline">Match Your Pipeline</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Match Your Pipeline-Working Space vs. Output Space"></span><strong id="Working Space vs. Output Space">Working Space vs. Output Space</strong>: In a well-managed color pipeline, you’ll define a working color space (such as ACES, sRGB, or something custom) and an output space (such as Rec.709 for broadcast, DCI-P3 for digital cinema, etc.). The viewer should simulate how your final output will appear on the target device.

<li>
<span id="Match Your Pipeline-OCIO/Color Management"></span><strong id="OCIO/Color Management">OCIO/Color Management</strong>: If your studio or project uses OpenColorIO (OCIO) or Nuke’s built‑in color management system, you’ll set up a config that determines how READ nodes’ colors are converted into your working space. Then you pick a viewer transform (often specified as “Viewer Process” or “Display Transform”) that shows you the image as it would appear on the intended display device.

</ul>
<div id="Consider Your Job’s Requirements"><h2 id="Consider Your Job’s Requirements" class="header"><a href="#Consider Your Job’s Requirements">Consider Your Job’s Requirements</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Consider Your Job’s Requirements-Identify Your Sources"></span><strong id="Identify Your Sources">Identify Your Sources</strong>: Determine the source material’s color space. For example, if you’re working with footage that comes in Rec.709 but you’re compositing in a linear space, you want your viewer to show you the correct “look” after all transforms have been applied.

<li>
<span id="Consider Your Job’s Requirements-Delivery Specs"></span><strong id="Delivery Specs">Delivery Specs</strong>: Check the deliverable requirements. A commercial that’s destined for HD broadcast might use Rec.709, while a feature film might require a DCI or ACES workflow. The viewer should be set up to mimic your final output so that what you see as you composite is an accurate representation of the end product.

</ul>
<div id="How to Establish the Correct Setting"><h2 id="How to Establish the Correct Setting" class="header"><a href="#How to Establish the Correct Setting">How to Establish the Correct Setting</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="How to Establish the Correct Setting-Project Brief / Pipeline Documentation"></span><strong id="Project Brief / Pipeline Documentation">Project Brief / Pipeline Documentation</strong>: The client or your technical director should clarify the color management requirements. This includes the intended viewing environment, the display standard, and what the “look” should be.

<li>
<span id="How to Establish the Correct Setting-Test Shots and Reference Targets"></span><strong id="Test Shots and Reference Targets">Test Shots and Reference Targets</strong>: You can use test plates or reference images (such as a calibrated chart) to check the colors. Adjust your viewer’s transform settings to match the expected final result on your calibrated monitor.

<li>
<span id="How to Establish the Correct Setting-Verify with Color Charts"></span><strong id="Verify with Color Charts">Verify with Color Charts</strong>: Using built‑in tools (like scopes or external monitors) can help you confirm that the viewer is displaying colors and exposure correctly.

<li>
<span id="How to Establish the Correct Setting-Configure the Viewer Node"></span><strong id="Configure the Viewer Node">Configure the Viewer Node</strong>: In Nuke, if you are using an OCIO config or a similar system, your Viewer node will usually pick up the settings from your project’s config. Verify that the “Viewer Process” (or similar control) is set to the correct display transform. For instance, if you’re working in ACES but need to see Rec.709 output, select the "ACES – ACEScg to Rec.709" transform in your viewer.

</ul>
<div id="Practical Example"><h2 id="Practical Example" class="header"><a href="#Practical Example">Practical Example</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Practical Example-Using ACES"></span><strong id="Using ACES">Using ACES</strong>: Suppose your project uses ACEScg as the working space and the final output is Rec.709.

<ul>
<li>
In Nuke’s project settings, you’d specify your OCIO config (for example, the ACES OCIO configuration).

<li>
In your Viewer node, choose the display transform that converts ACEScg to Rec.709.

<li>
This ensures that while your grading and compositing happen in a linear, wide-gamut space, what you see in the viewer closely approximates the final deliverable’s look.

</ul>
<li>
<span id="Practical Example-Without OCIO"></span><strong id="Without OCIO">Without OCIO</strong>: If you’re not using a full OCIO pipeline, you’d still want your viewer to be consistent. You might use a Grade node or a LUT node near the end of your comp to simulate the output transform. Then you can toggle that node on or off to see the image in its working space versus its output space.

</ul>
<div id="Practical Example-In Summary"><h3 id="In Summary" class="header"><a href="#Practical Example-In Summary">In Summary</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Practical Example-In Summary-Choose a Viewer Colorspace That Matches Your Final Output"></span><strong id="Choose a Viewer Colorspace That Matches Your Final Output">Choose a Viewer Colorspace That Matches Your Final Output</strong>: Whether it’s Rec.709, DCI-P3, or another standard depends on your job specs.

<li>
<span id="Practical Example-In Summary-Consult Your Pipeline Documentation"></span><strong id="Consult Your Pipeline Documentation">Consult Your Pipeline Documentation</strong>: Your project brief, technical director, or pipeline documentation should spell out the exact color spaces that must be used.

<li>
<span id="Practical Example-In Summary-Verify Using Test Material"></span><strong id="Verify Using Test Material">Verify Using Test Material</strong>: Check your viewer’s output against reference images and calibrated monitors to ensure that your corrections will translate correctly to the final deliverable.

</ul>
<p>
By ensuring your Nuke Viewer is set to the correct colorspace, you can be confident that your compositing, keying, and color corrections deliver the intended look across all delivery platforms.
