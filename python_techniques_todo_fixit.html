There isn't one "official" standard enforced across all projects, but there are widely accepted conventions and best practices that many teams and IDEs follow when using <code>TODO</code> comments. Here’s what you need to know:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Basic Syntax—Use Uppercase and a Consistent Format: The most common approach is as simple as writing a comment like:

</ul>
  
<pre c>
// TODO: Refactor this function to handle edge cases
</pre>

<p>
Using uppercase <code>TODO</code> (often followed by a colon) is a de facto standard. Many IDEs and code editors highlight these comments automatically and even allow you to navigate between them easily2.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Additional Context Is Helpful: While the basic <code>TODO</code> tag is enough for many cases, it can be beneficial to be a bit more descriptive. For example, you might include:

<ul>
<li>
A brief explanation of what needs to be done.

<li>
An identifier or initials of the person responsible (especially in a team setting).

<li>
A date or reference to an issue tracker. For instance:

</ul>
</ul>
  
<pre c>
// TODO (J.Doe, 2025-06-01): Replace the temporary algorithm with the one from the optimization ticket #1234.
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Distinguish Between Different Types of Work: In addition to <code>TODO</code>, you might see comments like <code>FIXME</code> (for things that are known to be broken and require fixing) or <code>XXX</code> (to mark areas of potential hazard or instability). This differentiation helps signal to developers not only that something needs to be done but also what kind of attention it requires.

<li>
Integrate with Your Workflow: Many development environments (like IntelliJ IDEA or VSCode) come with built-in support for listing and managing <code>TODOs</code>. This makes it easier to track outstanding work directly from your editor, but it also means that you might want to stick to a consistent format that your whole team agrees on. Some teams even have style guidelines stating how and when to use <code>TODOs</code> so they don’t accumulate into an unmanageable backlog.

<li>
Temporary vs. Permanent: Remember, <code>TODO</code> comments are a temporary measure. They’re great for noting work that needs to be done later, but relying on them as your only tracking method can lead to "hidden" technical debt. Ideally, they should either be linked to an issue in your project’s tracking system or be resolved within a reasonable time frame.

</ul>
<p>
In summary, while you’re usually just "slapping the word <code>TODO</code>" into a comment, there is a de facto standard:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use uppercase <code>TODO</code> (with an optional colon)

<li>
Add relevant, concise context when possible

<li>
Use additional tags (like <code>FIXME</code> or <code>XXX</code>) for different kinds of tasks

</ul>
<p>
Following this approach will not only make your code more self-documenting but also provide better integration with code editors and help your team manage pending tasks more effectively.
</p>

<div id="Examples in Use"><h1 id="Examples in Use" class="header"><a href="#Examples in Use">Examples in Use</a></h1></div>

<p>
Below are a few examples and best practices for using <code>TODO</code> comments in your code. While there isn’t a single “official” standard, many teams follow similar patterns that both developers and IDEs recognize.
</p>

<div id="Examples in Use-Basic Usage"><h3 id="Basic Usage" class="header"><a href="#Examples in Use-Basic Usage">Basic Usage</a></h3></div>

<p>
A simple <code>TODO</code> comment is usually marked in all uppercase with a colon. For example, in C/C++ or Java:
</p>

<pre java>
// TODO: Refactor this method to handle edge cases.
public void processData() {
    // ...
}
</pre>

<p>
Or in Python:
</p>

<pre python>
def fetch_data(url):
    # TODO: Handle network exceptions properly.
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
</pre>

<p>
This standard notation lets developers quickly search—and many IDEs automatically index—<code>TODO</code> comments.
</p>

<div id="Examples in Use-Enhanced Troubleshooting and Traceability"><h3 id="Enhanced Troubleshooting and Traceability" class="header"><a href="#Examples in Use-Enhanced Troubleshooting and Traceability">Enhanced Troubleshooting and Traceability</a></h3></div>

<p>
It’s often very helpful to add more context. For example, if you’re working on a team, include your initials or name along with a date, or reference an issue number. For example, in Java:
</p>

<pre java>
// TODO (JD, 2025-06-01, #1234): Replace the temporary algorithm with the optimized version.
public int calculateScore(int[] data) {
    // temporary implementation
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
In Python, you could do something similar:
</p>

<pre python>
def process_file(filename):
    # TODO (Jane, 2025-06-01): Add proper error handling for file not found.
    with open(filename) as file:
        return file.read()
</pre>

<p>
Adding these details ensures that when you—or someone else—come back later, you’ll have some background on why the task exists and who is responsible for resolving it.
</p>

<div id="Examples in Use-Using Preprocessor Directives"><h3 id="Using Preprocessor Directives" class="header"><a href="#Examples in Use-Using Preprocessor Directives">Using Preprocessor Directives</a></h3></div>

<p>
Some languages allow you to use preprocessor directives to surface warnings during compilation. For example, in C# you can write:
</p>

<pre csharp>
#warning TODO: Optimize the sorting algorithm before release.
public void SortData() {
    // sort implementation
}
</pre>

<p>
This method forces the compiler to emit a warning, making it less likely that the comment (and the associated work) is forgotten.
</p>

<div id="Examples in Use-Integration with IDEs"><h3 id="Integration with IDEs" class="header"><a href="#Examples in Use-Integration with IDEs">Integration with IDEs</a></h3></div>

<p>
Many IDEs, such as Visual Studio, Eclipse, or VS Code, can automatically detect these <code>TODO</code> comments and list them as tasks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Visual Studio: The Task List pane will automatically show lines with <code>// TODO:</code> or other designated tokens. This lets you navigate directly to the code that needs attention.

<li>
VS Code: Extensions such as “Todo Tree” can scan your project for <code>TODO</code> comments and display them in a navigable tree within the UI.

<li>
Eclipse: Eclipse can be configured to recognize custom tags in comments (like <code>TODO</code> or <code>FIXME</code>) and list them in a dedicated view.

</ul>
<p>
These features help maintain a dynamic to-do list that’s directly linked to your source code, ensuring that technical debt or work-in-progress items are visible.
</p>

<div id="Examples in Use-Other Related Tags"><h3 id="Other Related Tags" class="header"><a href="#Examples in Use-Other Related Tags">Other Related Tags</a></h3></div>

<p>
In addition to <code>TODO</code>, you might come across:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>FIXME</code>: Indicates something is broken and needs to be fixed.

<li>
<code>HACK</code>: Denotes a workaround or temporary solution that should eventually be replaced.

<li>
<code>XXX</code>: Often used to warn about a potential problem or something that is especially messy.

</ul>
<p>
For example, in a JavaScript file:
</p>

<pre javascript>
// FIXME: This function crashes when input is empty.
function processInput(input) {
    // ...
}

// HACK: Temporary fix until refactoring is done.
</pre>

<p>
These tags serve different purposes, and using them consistently makes it easier for anyone reviewing your code to prioritize what needs to be done.
</p>

<p>
These examples should give you a good idea of how to annotate and manage <code>TODO</code> comments within your codebase. Many developers and teams adopt a similar approach to ensure that uncompleted tasks are both visible and trackable through integrated development tools.

<div id="Using Vim to Manage T0DOs"><h1 id="Using Vim to Manage T0DOs" class="header"><a href="#Using Vim to Manage T0DOs">Using Vim to Manage T0DOs</a></h1></div>

<p>
Vim can be set up to work with TODOs and help you manage them more efficiently. There are a couple of approaches you can take:
</p>

<div id="Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-Using Vim’s Built-In Tools"><h3 id="Using Vim’s Built-In Tools" class="header"><a href="#Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-Using Vim’s Built-In Tools">Using Vim’s Built-In Tools</a></h3></div>

<p>
Even without plugins, Vim has powerful search and navigation features that can help you work through <code>TODO</code> comments:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Syntax Highlighting</code>: You can configure Vim to highlight <code>TODO</code> comments. For example, adding the following to your ~/.vimrc will highlight any occurrence of <code>TODO</code> in your files:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
autocmd Syntax * syn match Todo /\&lt;TODO\&gt;/
highlight link Todo WarningMsg
</pre>

<p>
This makes <code>TODO</code>s stand out in your code.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Finding <code>TODO</code>s with Search: You can use Vim’s search command to jump between <code>TODO</code> comments. For example, type:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
/TODO
</pre>

<p>
And then press n to jump to the next occurrence.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Quickfix List</code>: To list all <code>TODO</code> comments in your project, you can use :vimgrep along with the quickfix window:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:vimgrep /TODO/ **/*
:copen
</pre>

<p>
This will search for <code>TODO</code>s across files (using Vim’s globbing) and open the quickfix window so you can navigate through matches.
</p>

<div id="Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-Using Dedicated Plugins"><h3 id="Using Dedicated Plugins" class="header"><a href="#Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-Using Dedicated Plugins">Using Dedicated Plugins</a></h3></div>

<p>
If you’d like more robust management—like creating, checking off, and organizing tasks—there are several plugins designed for this:
</p>

<div id="Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-vim-todo-lists"><h2 id="vim-todo-lists" class="header"><a href="#Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-vim-todo-lists">vim-todo-lists</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Overview</code>:  vim-todo-lists is a Vim plugin specifically designed to manage <code>TODO</code> lists. It supports a Markdown-like syntax for tasks and provides commands to create new items, navigate between items, and mark items as done.

<li>
<code>Installation with vim-plug</code>: Add the following to your ~/.vimrc:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
Plug 'aserebryakov/vim-todo-lists'
</pre>
<p>
Then reload Vim and run :PlugInstall.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Usage Examples</code>: Once installed, items marked with the default syntax (e.g., - [ ] Task description for pending tasks and - [X] Task description for completed ones) will be recognized by the plugin. It provides commands such as:

<ul>
<li>
<code>:VimTodoListsCreateNewItemAbove</code>

<li>
<code>:VimTodoListsCreateNewItemBelow</code>

<li>
<code>:VimTodoListsGoToNextItem</code>

<li>
<code>:VimTodoListsGoToPreviousItem</code>

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
You can customize mappings in your configuration to jump between tasks or toggle their status.
</p>

<div id="Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-vim-todo-lists-Other Plugins"><h3 id="Other Plugins" class="header"><a href="#Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-vim-todo-lists-Other Plugins">Other Plugins</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>todo.txt-vim</code>: If you work with a plain text <code>TODO</code> format (the popular Todo.txt standard), then todo.txt-vim might be a better match. It facilitates managing your tasks within a dedicated file following that format.

<li>
<code>Task-Wiki or similar integrations</code>: For more elaborate setups, plugins like taskwiki integrate task management into Vim by connecting with task tracking systems like Taskwarrior.

</ul>
<div id="Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-Best Practices and Integration"><h2 id="Best Practices and Integration" class="header"><a href="#Using Vim to Manage T0DOs-Best Practices and Integration">Best Practices and Integration</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Consistent Commenting Style</code>: Adopt a standard such as always using <code>TODO</code>: in your code comments. That way both your search tools and plugins can recognize these markers.

</ul>
<p>
Mapping Keys: Create custom mappings in your Vim configuration to quickly navigate to the next <code>TODO</code>. For example:
</p>
  
<pre vim>
nnoremap &lt;Leader&gt;t /TODO&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This maps &lt;Leader&gt;t to a search for <code>TODO</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Use of Quickfix/Location List</code>: Even if you’re not using a dedicated plugin, combining Vim’s search with the quickfix window can give you a task-like interface to navigate through <code>TODO</code>s.

</ul>
<p>
In summary, Vim is very flexible in how you handle <code>TODO</code>s. Whether you prefer using plain search commands and custom mappings or fully featured plugins like vim-todo-lists or todo.txt-vim, you can tailor Vim to be a powerful tool for managing and navigating your tasks.
