Awesome.
I don't know if Jake will go for for the auroras going over the top of the chars or the color transition during the zoom, but personally I like them both.
* Could you do a couple of color tweaks before I send it to Dailies?:
    * Could you warm up sokka's skin/tongue
    * Warm up Toph's skin during the warm section?
* And can you push some blue saturation into the tears so they read better and distinguish themselves from the baby hand shapes?

Hey, Rob.
[start of shot screengrab reference]
* Would you mind getting a tiny bit more red and a tiny bit less green in his skin?
    * Might as well get a close match in this part of the shot.  Thanks!

3400_0070_comp_v08 – Rob H – First Review
</p>

<ul>
<li class="done4">
The blue is coming off a little too fast for the duration of the shot.

<ul>
<li>
We might want overall a warm read and swing into it at the tale.

</ul>
<li class="done4">
Add a bloom from the background over the top of the characters.

<li>
Foreground lines:

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Bias the moving lines so it’s not as prominent in the center and it isn’t going through their faces directly.

<li class="done4">
Make the moving lines in the foreground larger and faster for motion parallax.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Dale to take for approval. Approved with notes!

Thanks, Rob!  A couple of little nits.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can you start the transition from warm to cool at x1020?

<ul>
<li>
We want to ramp into it at the tail.

</ul>
<li>
And can you bring back some of the opacity on the fg lines?

<ul>
<li>
They seem to have some some of their presence.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Thanks!
(I don't mind if we get an occasional line going over a face that can be seen.)

Hey, Rob!  I finally have an answer on the note in 3400/70.  The final word from Jerry is just to remove all of the FG lines in the shot.  Once he started paring them further and further back, it didn't make sense to keep them at all.  Sorry about that!  Thanks for going on this journey with us.
PS:  Just a word of warning, according to the cut order in SG, shot 70 does not cut to shot 80, but rather shot 60, then shot 80.  So, I think once we do continuity for this sequence we'll probably lose the color transition as well.  That's my bad for not noticing the out of order shots.

No problem! Whatever works for the sequence. It's always good to have options and thrash out the best landing spot.

I guess I should run a version without the FG streaks, and then we'll have a base to do the color adjusts (transition/no transition) when we get to a continuity pass.
