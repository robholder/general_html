<li>
ImageMagick is missing svg and png support. Need to ask Andrew Titcomb:

This turns out to be some issue - maybe file error or restrictions.

</ul>
<li>
Ask Doug about his errors with CellSelect

Doug's script worked for me.

Good morning, Rob!  I'm sorry I didn't get to this friday night.  I think we made it, anyway.

It looks like overall the shot came down a little.  Could you go back to the brightness level in v10?
For the transparency, I don't think this bright shape really works, shining through the mass of the dust.  If we were to have something like that I think it would be broader and softer.  But at this point in the shot I think it's better just to turn the transparency off.  If you think the 1.2 isn't enough you could boost that a little.
Thanks!
