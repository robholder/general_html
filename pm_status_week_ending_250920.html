Reminders:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
ImageMagick is missing svg and png support. Need to ask Andrew Titcomb:

<ul>
<li>
This turns out to be some issue - maybe file error or restrictions.

</ul>
<li>
Ask Doug about his errors with CellSelect

<ul>
<li>
Doug's script worked for me.

s 3900 0140 - finished?

Quick tweak - Finalled.

Good morning, Rob!  I'm sorry I didn't get to this friday night.  I think we made it, anyway.

It looks like overall the shot came down a little.  Could you go back to the brightness level in v10?
For the transparency, I don't think this bright shape really works, shining through the mass of the dust.  If we were to have something like that I think it would be broader and softer.  But at this point in the shot I think it's better just to turn the transparency off.  If you think the 1.2 isn't enough you could boost that a little.
Thanks!

Super cool.  I like the crunching.
* Can you eradicate the orange?  It may be in the texture but we don't have it elsewhere in the sequence.  Let's stick to the blue/green/purples.
* Can you add some internal detail to the air bending.
    * Sarah's got a good example in shot 340.
* Can you do the same fx air puff treatments that Sarah did in 340?
That's it!  Thanks, Rob!

CellSelect Tool
Even though this tool can be ideal in many situations, I've added a Warning section to the top of the tool page about memory issues as follows.
It may be a great solution in many cases, but be aware that it can sometimes cause your memory usage to bloat (and potentially cause failure locally and on the farm). It's been used many times without issue, but be aware of possible memory drawbacks.
To help mitigate issues, these guides might help:
Consider precomping the mattes rather than generating them live with each render.
ALWAYS consider using garbage roto mattes in place of this tool - it may be quicker and less impactful in many cases
Try to place the CellSelect nodes as near to the source of the cell color image as possible (and try to steer away from placing CellSelect nodes after Colorpick nodes or color process in the character templates. This is an anecdotal observation of memory issues, but be aware of the possibility.
The tool is very unforgiving if the sample strays off specific color values. It’ll cause major issues if the tool finds itself over non-color pixels (as in outside of crop areas or off-screen areas). Even a single frame will cause it to fail.
[edit - tip added from Nafisa B and Mathew T] A last ditch memory management tweak is to try setting the chunking to a smaller size on the render farm. (There is a ‘Chunk’ size parameter on the Deadline Render Submit interface.)

Hey, Rob!  Color looks good.  Air bending looks good.
* The gas is still looking a bit 2D.
* I know these are CU's, but could you looks at shots 210 and/or 280 for the treatment?
* Maybe Sarah got away with something simpler in her shot because of distance from camera.  There's also shots 215, 270, 430 and 440, but I think they all basically have the same treatment on the gas.

In summary, ImageMagick seems to baulk at the SVG processing steps. (Errors indicate there's no image data to write - which I interpret as the SVG file not being processed.)
I've put together a directory with some test files (with a text file documenting what I've tried and what does/doesn't work).
/shows/avoa/users/rholder/linework/svg_examples/
Inside the directory are a few files:
commands.txt
(Text documenting my success and failures)
orig_lines.tif
This is the original line work to be run through the commands as a test case
rectangle_from_inkscape.svg
A test file directly from Inskscape - a simple rectangle as a path as a second file for SVG processing by ImageMagick

2230_0365_comp_v14 – Rob H – First Review
* Bring Katara down a half stop or so.
* The read on the airbending is nice.
* Lose a little more information on the shadow side and make it more top-down lighting. Lose the contrast.  
* Add a bit of a ramp on the other side of Katara – off screen glow from the moon.
Approved with notes!
