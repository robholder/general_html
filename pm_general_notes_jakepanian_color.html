Hello everyone.
</p>

<p>
0:02
I just want to go through a couple of things, that I do when I'm painting - when I'm setting up color keys or doing an illustration, and also just principles that we're using in this movie, and I think it might help in the early stages of setting up a comp, or at least that's the hope.
</p>

<p>
0:20
So let's say I'm painting a sphere and I'm just painting it by hand, in Photoshop.
</p>

<p>
0:25
, what I like to do is, let's say this is the local color, this is neutral light, in the shadow, I like to, go on a diagonal.
</p>

<p>
0:38
towards the, the dark, so meaning that as I'm going towards the shadow, I'm adding some saturation.
</p>

<p>
0:48
I like to typically be a little bit careful with saturation when I'm adding this.
</p>

<p>
0:54
so if you imagine, as things get darker, there's a line that would be drawn a diagonal in this color block, Yeah, like I said, I like to be careful because oftentimes, pitfall of this when I say it is, people can sometimes add way too much saturation in the shadows for the given light lighting situation.
</p>

<p>
1:18
So I would just say, it's all relative to what's around,, the object.
</p>

<p>
1:25
so anyway, so that's already that one hit where, where we are, able to make the sphere look quite round and then kind of getting closer to more of a contact shadow or oclusion here,, that's more of occlusion.
</p>

<p>
1:42
This could be more of a contact shadow, There and then let's say we want a rim light on it again, neutral light only, so continuing the idea of the diagonal line.
</p>

<p>
1:53
So I'm adding brightness but taking away saturation in this neutral light setting, I'll probably take more saturation out here.
</p>

<p>
2:03
, let's do like a, a rim light situation here.
</p>

<p>
2:11
And then let's say we want a highlight again.
</p>

<p>
2:15
, a little less saturation as we go up in the diagonal.
</p>

<p>
2:20
Something like this.
</p>

<p>
2:24
And we can, we can continue and like push this and get it feeling more and more.
</p>

<p>
2:28
, 3D and whatnot, but for the purposes, that we're talking about here, what's important is local color.
</p>

<p>
2:37
, the relationship with the shadow hue to the local color and the highlight in relation to the local color and moving on the diagonal, if you were to think of it in a color block, if you were to think of it as, huge saturation sliders, as it gets darker, the saturation goes up, and as it gets lighter, saturation goes down a little bit.
</p>

<p>
3:04
, and then.
</p>

<p>
3:08
If we were to take those same ideas and do it over a photo.
</p>

<p>
3:14
, But rather than now saying that we're, it's no longer local color, right, this is what I would.
</p>

<p>
3:24
Typically referred to as a parent color.
</p>

<p>
3:27
It's just what it appears to be in scene.
</p>

<p>
3:30
So you're setting an object into an environment.
</p>

<p>
3:33
So when I'm doing this, I again for any illustration, whether it's more flat or if it's the end result is going to be very 3D looking, I always try to express something very simple at the beginning, and I want when I'm doing a color he or an illustration, I want to simplest statement to read as if it rests in the environment.
</p>

<p>
3:58
So what I'm looking for is Just Something like this where just that alone all of a sudden like, OK, we're communicating that this is in shadow.
</p>

<p>
4:10
It makes sense, more sense to our eyes than to say this is in shadow.
</p>

<p>
4:14
And so that's, this is my first step.
</p>

<p>
4:17
and within this, I'm not just making it darker.
</p>

<p>
4:19
I'm adding, you know, a little bit of blue to the mids and just a touch of green, And I'm doing the same, same kind of step as before in this curves layer.
</p>

<p>
4:33
I'm I'm pulling down the the curves in the middle, which adds a little saturation.
</p>

<p>
4:39
, And then same thing in the the highlights.
</p>

<p>
4:44
I'm pulling the highlight up in the middle, but then I'm pulling blue out so it appears to be warmer, which will, you know, sink it into the environment more.
</p>

<p>
4:56
I'm looking at the color of the snow and for the shadow I'm looking at the color of this tree over here.
</p>

<p>
5:01
So just in general trying to check myself against surrounding objects that are near it foreshadows what's near to the object object.
</p>

<p>
5:12
And then for for lighting, I typically, you know, whatever the sky is doing dic dictates so much about what's in the scene.
</p>

<p>
5:20
and then I'll just continue to be playing around with adjustments, I think I did this twice, and, Yeah, and then I might.
</p>

<p>
5:33
I, I play a lot with atmosphere if you remember in the other video, there's the the use of atmospherics as a unifying factor.
</p>

<p>
5:42
If we were painting it, it would be like a wash that we, we would put over everything to make it feel unified like some sometimes things can feel a bit desperate and then you add a wash over painting and kind of Makes things feel cohesive and then if you're to put atmosphere over this, it's like oh OK, these things are all related with the gradient is, is affecting everything in the, in the scene, if that's what we wanted, right?
</p>

<p>
6:08
but again, What I'm really looking for and the bigger point I think here is this first, this first step of, making it read flat, and then once we have that kind of figured out, then we go and add the little bells and whistles like this.
</p>

<p>
6:28
So if we were to do, the same thing to a character.
</p>

<p>
6:35
, I would be.
</p>

<p>
6:39
Doing the same thing, so a broad adjustment over over everything, to make him feel.
</p>

<p>
6:45
, kind of set in the scene again, cooling it off slightly, looking around at the surroundings, And just maybe just touch magenta in there and then.
</p>

<p>
7:00
You know, I will, I will go through and kind of start editing what I think needs a further adjustment like his, his big gray and his wrist guards and, and kind of leg leggings.
</p>

<p>
7:12
maybe they feel a little bright here and, maybe his arrow feels a little bright, darkening this down.
</p>

<p>
7:19
So I'm just, I'm still within the flat.
</p>

<p>
7:21
, component of this and just trying to, trying to work with what we have delivered in terms of what would be local colors and shadow shapes and Going through, just, yeah, and then typically just.
</p>

<p>
7:38
darkening the underside of the cape as a unit, so it just reads more clearly that that's,, further away.
</p>

<p>
7:48
And then once we have that kind of blocked out.
</p>

<p>
7:54
That's when I would start to play with some, some occlusion shadows and things like that, Yeah, and.
</p>

<p>
8:07
Then after.
</p>

<p>
8:10
That Again with the the blooms, if, if needed, you know.
</p>

<p>
8:16
, So I hope that helps, and I think, I think the again, the big thing.
</p>

<p>
8:23
I would be trying to suggest is just keeping it simple up front and looking for this simple statement.
</p>

<p>
8:33
So you can avoid things like this.
</p>

<p>
8:36
let's say we have a shadows that are reading a little bit, like the hue might be unrelated now to the The background.
</p>

<p>
8:51
So the shadows, shadows on his legs and shadows on the cape now feel slightly disconnected.
</p>

<p>
8:56
And why is that?
</p>

<p>
8:57
There's a little more green now in both of those and and the cape is a little too light and it takes away some believability, based on the surroundings, right?
</p>

<p>
9:09
so these are the things that will be common notes for me that might explain like the subtle difference of color choices.
</p>

<p>
9:18
And In some of the notes.
</p>

<p>
9:22
So, one thing that I want to also show as an example is something from For me, what is one of my favorite, childhood movies, Secret and Em, I've already mentioned it a couple of times in rounds so, you know, I'm a fan of it, but like I think this, this one we're looking at it for it, it is, great, it's beautiful.
</p>

<p>
9:52
But, you know, they're definitely making stylistic choices to make the characters read, right?
</p>

<p>
9:56
They're very flat.
</p>

<p>
9:58
They are cohesive with the hues around them, but kind of from an illustrative point of view, meaning that they aren't really responding to physical light, atmospheric light or volumetric light, things like that, because if we were to look at that and and consider a slightly more 3D aesthetic and we look at The fact that they, they would kind of be in silhouette, there is a cool shadow on this tree that they're standing on.
</p>

<p>
10:25
the, the shadows on the tree are pretty heavy.
</p>

<p>
10:28
So all of a sudden if you start considering those things like, oh, this feels, like it's like it's actually, not that cohesive, but again, it's intentional how they're approaching it and there's nothing wrong with it.
</p>

<p>
10:40
It's just that for our style, we're kind of combining this 2D aesthetic.
</p>

<p>
10:45
With the 3D aesthetic and it's this funky middle ground, which can be a little bit hard to, to kind of.
</p>

<p>
10:54
, grasp, I think at first, but, but, hopefully what I'm talking about here will help.
</p>

<p>
11:02
So if you just imagine a 2D.
</p>

<p>
11:06
Aesthetic, but 1 ft into 3D aesthetics and the way we get there is remembering how to paint this sphere, the way that we, that I showed in the beginning and possibly the way that you might break down the initial steps of, of a comp.
</p>

<p>
11:25
anyway, I hope that helps and let me know if you have any questions.
</p>

<p>
11:29
Thank you.
