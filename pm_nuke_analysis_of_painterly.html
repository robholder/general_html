<p>
This expression is shorthand for normalizing the red and green channels by dividing each by the value of the channel named "Le." In other words, it does the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Le = sqrt((Red*Red) + (Green*Green))+0.00000001

</ul>
<p>
For the red channel, it sets the new value to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Red / Le

</ul>
<p>
For the green channel, it sets the new value to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Green / Le

</ul>
<div id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-What It Means"><h4 id="What It Means" class="header"><a href="#NVO-Normalization of P vectors-What It Means">What It Means</a></h4></div>

<p>
Normalization or Unpremultiplication: By dividing the red and green values by another channel (in this case, "Le"), you effectively remove the influence of that channel’s overall intensity. Often in compositing workflows you may want to isolate color information by removing the contribution of luminance or a matte value. If "Le" is serving as a luminance (or even an alpha-like) channel, this operation will leave you with normalized color values.
</p>

<div id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Use Cases:"><h4 id="Use Cases:" class="header"><a href="#NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Use Cases:">Use Cases:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Use Cases:-Color Correction:"></span><strong id="Color Correction:">Color Correction:</strong> When you need to adjust or balance color channels independently of their brightness.

<span id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Use Cases:-Matte Extraction / Keying:"></span><strong id="Matte Extraction / Keying:">Matte Extraction / Keying:</strong> When "Le" represents a luma or matte channel that you want to use to drive further operations, dividing by it can help separate pure color data.

<li>
<span id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Use Cases:-Unpremultiplication:"></span><strong id="Unpremultiplication:">Unpremultiplication:</strong> A similar concept where colors are divided by an alpha channel to undo the premultiply (though here the channel is named “Le” instead of “alpha”).

</ul>
<div id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Example Scenario"><h4 id="Example Scenario" class="header"><a href="#NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Example Scenario">Example Scenario</a></h4></div>

<p>
Imagine you have a layer where the intensity of a light (or a matte) is stored in the "Le" channel. By computing:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Red = Red / Le

<li>
Green = Green / Le

</ul>
<p>
You remove the influence of that intensity from the red and green channels. The result is a set of color ratios that can be used for further processing—perhaps to reintroduce a controlled amount of that light later on or to drive a keying process that is independent of the brightness variations.
</p>

...in a Nuke Expression node adjust the red and green channels by dividing them by the "Le" channel, effectively normalizing these channels to isolate color information from overall intensity.

<div id="NVO-The Le Expression"><h3 id="The Le Expression" class="header"><a href="#NVO-The Le Expression">The Le Expression</a></h3></div>

<p>
This expression calculates the magnitude of the red/green vector and adds a tiny offset to prevent division by zero. Here's a breakdown:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
sqrt((Red*Red) + (Green*Green)): This part computes the Euclidean distance (or length) of the vector formed by the Red and Green channels. In other words, it takes the square root of the sum of the squares of Red and Green values. This is analogous to calculating the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the legs are the Red and Green values.

<li>
+ 0.00000001: The extremely small number is added to ensure that Le never becomes exactly zero. This is important because if you later divide by Le (like in your expressions for Red/Le and Green/Le), you want to avoid a division-by-zero error.

</ul>
<div id="NVO-The Le Expression-What It Achieves Overall"><h4 id="What It Achieves Overall" class="header"><a href="#NVO-The Le Expression-What It Achieves Overall">What It Achieves Overall</a></h4></div>

<p>
By defining Le in this way, you create a measure of the overall intensity or "length" of the color vector in the red-green plane. When you use it to normalize the red and green channels (by dividing each by Le), you obtain the directional information independent of the magnitude. This is useful for operations like:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="NVO-The Le Expression-What It Achieves Overall-Normalization:"></span><strong id="Normalization:">Normalization:</strong> Isolating color direction regardless of intensity.

<li>
<span id="NVO-The Le Expression-What It Achieves Overall-Unpremultiplying:"></span><strong id="Unpremultiplying:">Unpremultiplying:</strong> Removing the influence of brightness or a particular matte.

</ul>
<p>
This approach is common in compositing or image processing tasks where you might need to re-map or adjust color values more robustly.

<div id="fbm_noise"><h1 id="fbm_noise" class="header"><a href="#fbm_noise">fbm_noise</a></h1></div>

<p>
This expression is calling a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) noise function with inputs that let you customize the noise’s appearance based on coordinates and various parameters. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:
</p>

<div id="fbm_noise-The Expression"><h2 id="The Expression" class="header"><a href="#fbm_noise-The Expression">The Expression</a></h2></div>

Coordinate Transformation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-r, g, b:"></span><strong id="r, g, b:">r, g, b:</strong> These typically represent your base coordinate values or channel values. Although their names imply “color” channels, in many noise setups they are repurposed as the x, y, and z spatial coordinates.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-xScale, yScale, zScale:"></span><strong id="xScale, yScale, zScale:">xScale, yScale, zScale:</strong> These factors scale the corresponding coordinate axes. By adjusting them, you change the “frequency” or “detail” of the noise along each axis.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-globalScale:"></span><strong id="globalScale:">globalScale:</strong> Dividing by globalScale normalizes or adjusts the overall scale of the noise. This lets you control the noise granularity on a global level.

They shift the input domain of the noise function, essentially “moving” the noise pattern in space.

</ul>
<p>
fBm Noise Function Parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-oct:"></span><strong id="oct:">oct:</strong> Short for “octaves,” this parameter defines how many layers (or frequency iterations) of noise to combine. More octaves usually mean more detail and complexity in the final noise.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-lac:"></span><strong id="lac:">lac:</strong> This represents “lacunarity,” which determines the frequency multiplier between successive octaves. It controls how quickly the frequency increases as you add higher levels of detail.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-gain:"></span><strong id="gain:">gain:</strong> This governs the amplitude scaling between octaves. It tells you how much each successive octave contributes relative to the previous one, affecting the overall contrast and "roughness" of the noise.

<li>

Adjusting xScale, globalScale, and the other parameters lets you tailor the noise—from gentle turbulence to high-frequency textural detail.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-What the Expression Achieves-Seamless Control Over Appearance:"></span><strong id="Seamless Control Over Appearance:">Seamless Control Over Appearance:</strong> The use of coordinate scaling and offsets (pos.x/y/z) means you can precisely position and resize the noise’s features. The parameters oct, lac, and gain allow you to dial in the complexity and visual roughness, making this a very flexible tool in your compositing workflow.

</ul>
<p>
Practical Use in Nuke
</p>

<p>
You might connect this fBm expression to drive procedural texture effects, displacement maps, or create natural-looking randomness in effects like clouds, rust, or surface imperfections. Because the transformation is fully parameterized, you can animate the position or adjust the scales over time to create dynamic, evolving noise.
</p>

<p>
This expression is a compact, yet powerful way to leverage procedural (fractal) noise in Nuke. Let me know if you’d like to explore further examples, such as how to incorporate time-based variations or combine multiple noise layers for even more intricate effects!

<div id="Color Matrix"><h1 id="Color Matrix" class="header"><a href="#Color Matrix">Color Matrix</a></h1></div>

<p>
Let's break down what the 3×3 matrix is doing when you use it to adjust the vector direction of your noise:
</p>

<p>
Imagine your input is treated as a 3‑component vector 
</p>

<pre plaintext>
[ 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑧 ].
</pre>

<p>
In your case, you're only interested in a 2D transformation—the components corresponding to <code>𝑥</code> and <code>𝑦.</code> Your matrix is set up so that only the first two rows and the first two columns are active. In other words, your matrix looks something like this:
</p>

<pre plaintext>
[ 𝑎 𝑏 0 ]
[ 𝑐 𝑑 0 ]
[ 0 0 0 ]
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Row 1 (cells <code>[ 𝑎 , 𝑏 , 0 ]</code>) -  This row defines how the output’s first component (let’s call it the transformed <code>𝑥</code>) is calculated from the input vector:

</ul>
  
<pre plaintext>
𝑥′ = 𝑎 × 𝑥 + 𝑏 × 𝑦
</pre>

<p>
You have two cells activated here (the multipliers for the <code>𝑥</code> and <code>𝑦</code> inputs), which you can adjust to control the contribution of the original <code>𝑥</code> and <code>𝑦</code> to the new <code>𝑥</code> .
</p>

<p>
Row 2 (cells <code>[ 𝑐 , 𝑑 , 0 ]</code>) - This row defines the output’s second component (the transformed 𝑦):
</p>
<pre plaintext>
𝑦 ′ = 𝑐 × 𝑥 + 𝑑 × 𝑦
</pre>

<p>
Again, only the first two cells here are active. Changing these values lets you control how the original <code>𝑥</code> and <code>𝑦</code> mix to produce the new <code>𝑦.</code>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Row 3 (all cells set to zero) Since row 3 is entirely zero, the third output channel (or the <code>𝑧</code> component) is forced to 0, meaning it plays no role in your transformation.

<li>
Column 3 (all zeros) Having zeros in column three means that the third component of your input (whatever is stored there) doesn't contribute to either the transformed <code>𝑥</code> or <code>𝑦</code> outputs.

</ul>
<div id="Color Matrix-What This Accomplishes"><h3 id="What This Accomplishes" class="header"><a href="#Color Matrix-What This Accomplishes">What This Accomplishes</a></h3></div>

<p>
2D Linear Transformation: By only using a 2×2 submatrix from the overall 3×3 matrix, you’re effectively applying a linear transformation (rotation, scaling, or shearing) to your 2D coordinates (the <code>𝑥</code> and <code>𝑦</code> inputs). For example, if you set your active cells to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
𝑎 = cos𝜃

<li>
𝑏 = − sin𝜃

<li>
𝑐 = sin𝜃

<li>
𝑑 = cos𝜃

</ul>
<p>
...then you’re rotating your noise’s vector by an angle <code>𝜃.</code>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Color Matrix-What This Accomplishes-Isolating the 2D Behavior:"></span><strong id="Isolating the 2D Behavior:">Isolating the 2D Behavior:</strong> The fact that all of column three and all of row three are zero means you intentionally ignore any third-channel data (such as a z component or an additional parameter). This is typical when your effect is solely based on 2D behavior (such as tiling or directional noise in a plane).

<li>
<span id="Color Matrix-What This Accomplishes-Control Over Vector Direction:"></span><strong id="Control Over Vector Direction:">Control Over Vector Direction:</strong> You can fine-tune the exact behavior of your noise’s directional properties by adjusting the active cells. For instance, you might not only rotate the vector but also scale it (by changing the magnitude of <code>𝑎</code>, <code>𝑏</code>, <code>𝑐</code>, and <code>𝑑)</code> to achieve the desired intensity or sharpness in your noise pattern.

</ul>
<div id="Color Matrix-What This Accomplishes-In Summary"><h4 id="In Summary" class="header"><a href="#Color Matrix-What This Accomplishes-In Summary">In Summary</a></h4></div>

<p>
Your 3×3 ColorMatrix in the context of adjusting noise is functioning as a 2D transformation tool:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The first row’s two active cells control how much of the original <code>𝑥</code> and <code>𝑦</code> contribute to the new <code>𝑥</code>

<li>
The second row’s two active cells handle the contribution to the new 𝑦.

<li>
Everything else (the entire third row and column three) is set to zero to effectively isolate and ignore any additional data outside the 2D transformation.

</ul>
<p>
This approach is a common technique to adjust the vector direction of noise, allowing for precise control over how your noise pattern is oriented and scaled in the 2D space.
