<p>
This expression is shorthand for normalizing the red and green channels by dividing each by the value of the channel named "Le." In other words, it does the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Le = sqrt((Red*Red) + (Green*Green))+0.00000001

</ul>
<p>
For the red channel, it sets the new value to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Red / Le

</ul>
<p>
For the green channel, it sets the new value to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Green / Le

</ul>
<div id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-What It Means"><h4 id="What It Means" class="header"><a href="#NVO-Normalization of P vectors-What It Means">What It Means</a></h4></div>

<p>
Normalization or Unpremultiplication: By dividing the red and green values by another channel (in this case, "Le"), you effectively remove the influence of that channel’s overall intensity. Often in compositing workflows you may want to isolate color information by removing the contribution of luminance or a matte value. If "Le" is serving as a luminance (or even an alpha-like) channel, this operation will leave you with normalized color values.

<ul>
<li>
<span id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Use Cases:-Color Correction:"></span><strong id="Color Correction:">Color Correction:</strong> When you need to adjust or balance color channels independently of their brightness.

<span id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Use Cases:-Matte Extraction / Keying:"></span><strong id="Matte Extraction / Keying:">Matte Extraction / Keying:</strong> When "Le" represents a luma or matte channel that you want to use to drive further operations, dividing by it can help separate pure color data.

<li>
<span id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Use Cases:-Unpremultiplication:"></span><strong id="Unpremultiplication:">Unpremultiplication:</strong> A similar concept where colors are divided by an alpha channel to undo the premultiply (though here the channel is named “Le” instead of “alpha”).

</ul>
<div id="NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Example Scenario"><h4 id="Example Scenario" class="header"><a href="#NVO-Normalization of P vectors-Example Scenario">Example Scenario</a></h4></div>

<p>
Imagine you have a layer where the intensity of a light (or a matte) is stored in the "Le" channel. By computing:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Red = Red / Le

<li>
Green = Green / Le

</ul>
<p>
You remove the influence of that intensity from the red and green channels. The result is a set of color ratios that can be used for further processing—perhaps to reintroduce a controlled amount of that light later on or to drive a keying process that is independent of the brightness variations.
</p>

...in a Nuke Expression node adjust the red and green channels by dividing them by the "Le" channel, effectively normalizing these channels to isolate color information from overall intensity.

<div id="NVO-The Le Expression"><h3 id="The Le Expression" class="header"><a href="#NVO-The Le Expression">The Le Expression</a></h3></div>

<p>
This expression calculates the magnitude of the red/green vector and adds a tiny offset to prevent division by zero. Here's a breakdown:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
sqrt((Red*Red) + (Green*Green)): This part computes the Euclidean distance (or length) of the vector formed by the Red and Green channels. In other words, it takes the square root of the sum of the squares of Red and Green values. This is analogous to calculating the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the legs are the Red and Green values.

<li>
+ 0.00000001: The extremely small number is added to ensure that Le never becomes exactly zero. This is important because if you later divide by Le (like in your expressions for Red/Le and Green/Le), you want to avoid a division-by-zero error.

</ul>
<div id="NVO-The Le Expression-What It Achieves Overall"><h4 id="What It Achieves Overall" class="header"><a href="#NVO-The Le Expression-What It Achieves Overall">What It Achieves Overall</a></h4></div>

<p>
By defining Le in this way, you create a measure of the overall intensity or "length" of the color vector in the red-green plane. When you use it to normalize the red and green channels (by dividing each by Le), you obtain the directional information independent of the magnitude. This is useful for operations like:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="NVO-The Le Expression-What It Achieves Overall-Normalization:"></span><strong id="Normalization:">Normalization:</strong> Isolating color direction regardless of intensity.

<li>
<span id="NVO-The Le Expression-What It Achieves Overall-Unpremultiplying:"></span><strong id="Unpremultiplying:">Unpremultiplying:</strong> Removing the influence of brightness or a particular matte.

</ul>
<p>
This approach is common in compositing or image processing tasks where you might need to re-map or adjust color values more robustly.

<div id="fbm_noise"><h1 id="fbm_noise" class="header"><a href="#fbm_noise">fbm_noise</a></h1></div>

<p>
This expression is calling a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) noise function with inputs that let you customize the noise’s appearance based on coordinates and various parameters. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:
</p>

<div id="fbm_noise-The Expression"><h2 id="The Expression" class="header"><a href="#fbm_noise-The Expression">The Expression</a></h2></div>

<pre plaintext>
fBm(r*xScale/globalScale + pos.x,  g*yScale/globalScale + pos.y,  b*zScale/globalScale + pos.z,  oct, lac, gain)
</pre>

<p>
Coordinate Transformation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-r, g, b:"></span><strong id="r, g, b:">r, g, b:</strong> These typically represent your base coordinate values or channel values. Although their names imply “color” channels, in many noise setups they are repurposed as the x, y, and z spatial coordinates.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-xScale, yScale, zScale:"></span><strong id="xScale, yScale, zScale:">xScale, yScale, zScale:</strong> These factors scale the corresponding coordinate axes. By adjusting them, you change the “frequency” or “detail” of the noise along each axis.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-globalScale:"></span><strong id="globalScale:">globalScale:</strong> Dividing by globalScale normalizes or adjusts the overall scale of the noise. This lets you control the noise granularity on a global level.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-pos.x, pos.y, pos.z:"></span><strong id="pos.x, pos.y, pos.z:">pos.x, pos.y, pos.z:</strong> These are offset values (position offsets) added to the respective coordinates. They shift the input domain of the noise function, essentially “moving” the noise pattern in space.

</ul>
<p>
fBm Noise Function Parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-oct:"></span><strong id="oct:">oct:</strong> Short for “octaves,” this parameter defines how many layers (or frequency iterations) of noise to combine. More octaves usually mean more detail and complexity in the final noise.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-lac:"></span><strong id="lac:">lac:</strong> This represents “lacunarity,” which determines the frequency multiplier between successive octaves. It controls how quickly the frequency increases as you add higher levels of detail.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-Breaking Down the Components-gain:"></span><strong id="gain:">gain:</strong> This governs the amplitude scaling between octaves. It tells you how much each successive octave contributes relative to the previous one, affecting the overall contrast and "roughness" of the noise.

</ul>
<div id="fbm_noise-The Expression-What the Expression Achieves"><h3 id="What the Expression Achieves" class="header"><a href="#fbm_noise-The Expression-What the Expression Achieves">What the Expression Achieves</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-What the Expression Achieves-Customizable Noise Texture:"></span><strong id="Customizable Noise Texture:">Customizable Noise Texture:</strong> By combining scaled and offset coordinates with multiple octaves of noise, the function generates a detailed, fractal-like noise pattern. Adjusting xScale, globalScale, and the other parameters lets you tailor the noise—from gentle turbulence to high-frequency textural detail.

<li>
<span id="fbm_noise-The Expression-What the Expression Achieves-Seamless Control Over Appearance:"></span><strong id="Seamless Control Over Appearance:">Seamless Control Over Appearance:</strong> The use of coordinate scaling and offsets (pos.x/y/z) means you can precisely position and resize the noise’s features. The parameters oct, lac, and gain allow you to dial in the complexity and visual roughness, making this a very flexible tool in your compositing workflow.

</ul>
<p>
Practical Use in Nuke
</p>

<p>
You might connect this fBm expression to drive procedural texture effects, displacement maps, or create natural-looking randomness in effects like clouds, rust, or surface imperfections. Because the transformation is fully parameterized, you can animate the position or adjust the scales over time to create dynamic, evolving noise.
</p>

<p>
This expression is a compact, yet powerful way to leverage procedural (fractal) noise in Nuke. Let me know if you’d like to explore further examples, such as how to incorporate time-based variations or combine multiple noise layers for even more intricate effects!
