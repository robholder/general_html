A bit of a rant, but I've been thinking of the way this team was put together. What a truly 'sensible' way to build a team!

<p>
(In contrast to the industry standard of industry-ignorant laid-back pen-pushers holding the sword of Damocles over the heads of extremely dedicated an loyal artists and technicians, and seemingly making decisions on baseless whims. Roman and Dale have done the work of a whole recruiting department, and with precision - with Paramount's recruiting department doing what they know - the organization of logistics and 'enabling' rather than gatekeeping the team-building task. I appreciate the recruiters and HR for taking a supporting role to Roman and Dale, rather than the usual route of pen-sucking selections based on petty and transient nonsense.)
