<p>
There is a wrench on each node's property panel: click this to 'save' presets. These presets will appear as pulldown user choices. (Very handy for the Expression node.)
</p>

<div id="Nuke - Expression Node-Luminance"><h2 id="Luminance" class="header"><a href="#Nuke - Expression Node-Luminance">Luminance</a></h2></div>

<p>
In compositing and color science, luminance is typically expressed as a weighted sum of the red, green, and blue channels. In Nuke’s Expression node, you can calculate luminance by using one of the common standards.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you want to use the Rec.709 (or sRGB) standard, where the weights are approximately 0.2126 for red, 0.7152 for green, and 0.0722 for blue, your expression would be:
</p>

<pre plaintext>
0.2126*r + 0.7152*g + 0.0722*b
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, some legacy workflows use the Rec.601 standard, which uses weights close to 0.299 for red, 0.587 for green, and 0.114 for blue:
</p>

<pre plaintext>
0.299*r + 0.587*g + 0.114*b
</pre>

<p>
You can enter either one of these formulas in the Expression field of your Expression node. The chosen weights depend on your project’s color standards, but both formulas will calculate a luminance value that takes into account the perceptual sensitivity of the human eye.
</p>

<p>
There isn't any built-in “luminance” function in Nuke's expression language by default, so writing out the weighted sum is the typical approach. This gives you full control over the conversion and makes the process explicit in your node tree.
</p>

<p>
Below is one way you could handle single‑pixel NaNs with an Expression node by checking if a channel’s value is NaN and, if so, replacing it with an average of its eight immediate neighbors. (You’d want to replicate or modify the expression similarly for each channel as needed.) For example, for the red channel, you could write:
</p>

<pre nuke>
isnan(r) ? (r[-1,0] + r[1,0] + r[0,-1] + r[0,1] + r[-1,-1] + r[1,-1] + r[-1,1] + r[1,1]) / 8 : r
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Nuke - Expression Node-Fixing Single Pixel NaNs with an Expression-Explanation-Detecting NaNs"></span><strong id="Detecting NaNs">Detecting NaNs</strong>: The function <code>isnan(r)</code> checks if the current pixel’s red channel is a NaN value.

<li>
<span id="Nuke - Expression Node-Fixing Single Pixel NaNs with an Expression-Explanation-Sampling Neighboring Pixels"></span><strong id="Sampling Neighboring Pixels">Sampling Neighboring Pixels</strong>: The notation <code>r[dx, dy]</code> lets you sample the red channel from the pixel offset by <code>dx</code> (horizontal) and <code>dy</code> (vertical) from the current pixel. For example, <code>r[-1,0]</code> samples the pixel one unit to the left, and <code>r[0,1]</code> one unit below.

<li>
Alternately, you can use <code>r(x-1, y)</code> and <code>r(x, y+1)</code> syntax.

<li>
<span id="Nuke - Expression Node-Fixing Single Pixel NaNs with an Expression-Explanation-Averaging"></span><strong id="Averaging">Averaging</strong>: When the current pixel is NaN, the expression sums the red values of the eight neighboring pixels and divides by 8, thereby replacing the NaN with their average.

<li>
<span id="Nuke - Expression Node-Fixing Single Pixel NaNs with an Expression-Explanation-Fallback"></span><strong id="Fallback">Fallback</strong>: If the current pixel isn’t NaN, it simply uses the original red value.

<p>
If you need to do this for the green and blue channels, you can create similar expressions, substituting r with g and b respectively:
</p>

isnan(g) ? (g[-1,0] + g[1,0] + g[0,-1] + g[0,1] + g[-1,-1] + g[1,-1] + g[-1,1] + g[1,1]) / 8 : g
</pre>

isnan(b) ? (b[-1,0] + b[1,0] + b[0,-1] + b[0,1] + b[-1,-1] + b[1,-1] + b[-1,1] + b[1,1]) / 8 : b
</pre>

<div id="Nuke - Expression Node-Fixing Single Pixel NaNs with an Expression-Caveats"><h3 id="Caveats" class="header"><a href="#Nuke - Expression Node-Fixing Single Pixel NaNs with an Expression-Caveats">Caveats</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Nuke - Expression Node-Fixing Single Pixel NaNs with an Expression-Caveats-Edge Pixels"></span><strong id="Edge Pixels">Edge Pixels</strong>: Be aware that at the borders of the image there might not be eight neighbors, so you might need to implement safeguards or pre‑filter the image to avoid artifacts at the edges.

<li>
<span id="Nuke - Expression Node-Fixing Single Pixel NaNs with an Expression-Caveats-Multiple Pixels"></span><strong id="Multiple Pixels">Multiple Pixels</strong>: This expression only fixes pixels that are NaN on their own. If you have clusters of NaNs, additional logic or a different approach (such as a blur or a more sophisticated neighborhood interpolation) may be needed.

</ul>
<p>
This technique lets you “heal” isolated NaN pixels by blending information from their local area, which is often sufficient for many compositing tasks in Nuke. Enjoy experimenting with your expressions!
</p>

<div id="Edge Pixels"><h1 id="Edge Pixels" class="header"><a href="#Edge Pixels">Edge Pixels</a></h1></div>

<p>
There are a few strategies you can use to safeguard against edge cases (literally!) when sampling neighborhood pixels. The idea is to avoid trying to sample pixels beyond the image's borders. Here are some common techniques:
</p>

<div id="Edge Pixels-Pre-Extend or Clamp the Image Data"><h2 id="Pre-Extend or Clamp the Image Data" class="header"><a href="#Edge Pixels-Pre-Extend or Clamp the Image Data">Pre-Extend or Clamp the Image Data</a></h2></div>

<p>
The easiest and most robust approach is often to modify your node tree upstream so that the image data is effectively “padded” at the edges. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Edge Pixels-Pre-Extend or Clamp the Image Data-EdgeExtend or Border Node"></span><strong id="EdgeExtend or Border Node">EdgeExtend or Border Node</strong>: Use an upstream node (like a Border or Copy node set to extend the edges) that replicates or clamps the edge pixels. This way, every lookup—even for pixels outside the original image boundaries—returns a valid value.

<li>
<span id="Edge Pixels-Pre-Extend or Clamp the Image Data-Clamp the Coordinates"></span><strong id="Clamp the Coordinates">Clamp the Coordinates</strong>: In some cases, you may be able to clamp your sample coordinates using an expression. Although Nuke’s expression node might not provide a dedicated <code>clamp()</code> function, you can sometimes simulate it using conditional operators. For example, for the left neighbor you might write:
<pre nuke>
x &gt; 0 ? r[-1,0] : r[0,0]
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
This checks if <code>x &gt; 0</code>; if not, it falls back to the current pixel’s value. You’d need a similar condition for each neighbor so that out-of-bound positions default to the nearest in-bound pixel.
</p>

<div id="Edge Pixels-Conditional Sampling Within the Expression"><h2 id="Conditional Sampling Within the Expression" class="header"><a href="#Edge Pixels-Conditional Sampling Within the Expression">Conditional Sampling Within the Expression</a></h2></div>

<p>
If you want to handle the edge case entirely inside the Expression node, you can manually check the current pixel’s position. For example, assuming you have access to the current coordinates and the image dimensions (via variables like <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code>):
</p>

<pre nuke>
(
  x &gt; 0 ? r[-1,0] : r[0,0]
  + x &lt; width-1 ? r[1,0] : r[0,0]
  + y &gt; 0 ? r[0,-1] : r[0,0]
  + y &lt; height-1 ? r[0,1] : r[0,0]
  + x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &gt; 0 ? r[-1,-1] : r[0,0]
  + x &lt; width-1 &amp;&amp; y &gt; 0 ? r[1,-1] : r[0,0]
  + x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; height-1 ? r[-1,1] : r[0,0]
  + x &lt; width-1 &amp;&amp; y &lt; height-1 ? r[1,1] : r[0,0]
) / 8
</pre>

<p>
This example uses conditional (ternary) expressions so that if an offset would be outside the image dimensions, it substitutes the current pixel’s value (or any other fallback value). This approach can get messy quickly, however, especially if you need to do it for every color channel.
</p>

<p>
In Nuke, you’d typically insert an expression like this into an Expression node’s field for the channel you want to process (for example, the red channel). However, if your expression is very long, it might not be very practical to type or edit it directly in the single‑line text input.
</p>

<p>
Some versions of Nuke allow you to open a larger editor by right-clicking on an Expression field and choosing an “Edit…” option. This lets you work with the expression over multiple lines, making it easier to read and debug.
</p>

<p>
The cleanest solution for edge handling is sometimes not to include all the conditional logic in your expression at all. Instead, you might use an upstream node (like an Edge Extend, Border, or Reformat node configured to clamp values) to pad out the image so that every pixel lookup remains valid.
</p>

<div id="Edge Pixels-Using an Upstream Node to Control Border Behavior"><h2 id="Using an Upstream Node to Control Border Behavior" class="header"><a href="#Edge Pixels-Using an Upstream Node to Control Border Behavior">Using an Upstream Node to Control Border Behavior</a></h2></div>

<p>
Often the cleanest solution is to let Nuke handle the border. For instance, you can add a Reformat node with a setting for edge extension, or use a FrameHold node set to “Extend” mode. This way, your expression doesn’t have to worry about boundaries because Nuke ensures that any lookup beyond the edge returns the clamped border pixel.
</p>

<div id="Edge Pixels-Final Thoughts"><h2 id="Final Thoughts" class="header"><a href="#Edge Pixels-Final Thoughts">Final Thoughts</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Edge Pixels-Final Thoughts-Preprocessing the Image"></span><strong id="Preprocessing the Image">Preprocessing the Image</strong>: For many compositing workflows, setting an upstream node (like Border/Extend) to pre-handle edge pixels is both easier and less error-prone.

<li>
<span id="Edge Pixels-Final Thoughts-Manual Safeguards"></span><strong id="Manual Safeguards">Manual Safeguards</strong>: Only if you need the logic within the Expression node itself should you consider adding conditional checks. While it offers precise control, it increases complexity.

</ul>
<p>
By adopting one of these strategies, you can ensure your averages are computed correctly even for pixels near the edge of the image.
</p>

<div id="Decimate an Image"><h1 id="Decimate an Image" class="header"><a href="#Decimate an Image">Decimate an Image</a></h1></div>

<p>
In Nuke's expression language, the expression
</p>

<pre plaintext>
!(x%10)*!(y%10)
</pre>

<p>
...works as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>x%10 and y%10</code>: These calculate the remainder when x (or y) is divided by 10. For any number, if it's a multiple of 10 the remainder is 0; otherwise, the remainder is non-zero.

<li>
<code>!</code> (Not operator): The <code>!</code> operator converts a value into its Boolean opposite. In this context, when a number is 0 (which is considered "false" in a Boolean sense), !0 becomes 1 ("true"). For any non-zero number ("true"), !non-zero results in 0 ("false").

<li>
<span id="Decimate an Image-Multiplication of the Booleans:"></span><strong id="Multiplication of the Booleans:">Multiplication of the Booleans:</strong> The expression multiplies the two Boolean results. It will only return 1 if both <code>!(x%10)</code> and <code>!(y%10)</code> are true (i.e. both equal to 1), which happens when both x and y are exact multiples of 10. If either is not a multiple of 10, one side becomes 0 and the multiplication returns 0.

</ul>
<div id="Decimate an Image-Summary"><h4 id="Summary" class="header"><a href="#Decimate an Image-Summary">Summary</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Decimate an Image-Summary-Result is 1:"></span><strong id="Result is 1:">Result is 1:</strong> When x is a multiple of 10 and y is a multiple of 10.

<li>
<span id="Decimate an Image-Summary-Result is 0:"></span><strong id="Result is 0:">Result is 0:</strong> Otherwise.

</ul>
<p>
This type of expression is often used to create a grid-like pattern (for example, a set of points) that only appears at positions where both coordinates are divisible by 10.
