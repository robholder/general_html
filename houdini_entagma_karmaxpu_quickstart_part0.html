This YouTube tutorial uses work by Alex Valentina as inspriation, and explores the Karma Renderer (in Houdini 19.5 at the time of making).
</p>

<div id="Houdini - KarmaXPU Quickstart Pt.0 - Preparing Our Geometry-Drawing The Outline Curve"><h2 id="Drawing The Outline Curve" class="header"><a href="#Houdini - KarmaXPU Quickstart Pt.0 - Preparing Our Geometry-Drawing The Outline Curve">Drawing The Outline Curve</a></h2></div>

<p>
To create the outline of the geometry, start with a regular <code>Geometry</code> node in the <code>Obj</code> context.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Inside the <code>Geometry</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Curve</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Set the <code>Primitive Type</code> to <code>Bezier</code> to get curved results.

<li>
Hit <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> in the Viewport (to activate the handle/tool)

<li>
<code>H</code> key to select <code>Auto Bezier Draw Mode</code>

<li>
<code>F</code> key for edit mode

<li>
<code>&lt;space&gt; 3</code> to get a front view.

<li>
Draw the shape and end by clicking back at the first point.

<li>
<code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> to return to regular Viewport mode. 

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Houdini - KarmaXPU Quickstart Pt.0 - Preparing Our Geometry-Preparing The curve"><h2 id="Preparing The curve" class="header"><a href="#Houdini - KarmaXPU Quickstart Pt.0 - Preparing Our Geometry-Preparing The curve">Preparing The curve</a></h2></div>

<p>
Next, we need to prepare the curve for use as a polygon generator.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Resample</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Reduce the <code>Length</code> parameter:

<li>
Switch on the <code>points</code> icon on the Viewport's right-most tool bar.

<ul>
<li>
Try <code>0.01</code>

<li>
The points should be very densely spaced.

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
To form a uniform mesh:

<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Remesh</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
It might not be very clean at first:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Target Size</code> to 0.01 (Zoom in to see the mesh)

</ul>
<li>
In the tutorial, there were some polygons that were squished up in areas:

<ul>
<li>
Adjust the <code>Iterations</code> (to <code>6</code> in the tutorial)

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Houdini - KarmaXPU Quickstart Pt.0 - Preparing Our Geometry-Grouping The Edge"><h2 id="Grouping The Edge" class="header"><a href="#Houdini - KarmaXPU Quickstart Pt.0 - Preparing Our Geometry-Grouping The Edge">Grouping The Edge</a></h2></div>

<p>
Next we'll extrude.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>PolyExtrude</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Slight extrude - <code>Distance</code> of 0.01

<li>
<code>Extrusion</code> tab:

<ul>
<li>
Check 'On' the <code>Output Back</code>

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Check 'On' the <code>Side Group</code> option:

<ul>
<li>
This will create a group of all the edge facing polygons of the extrude.

<li>
You can leave the <code>extrudeSide</code> name.

</ul>
<li>
Add a <code>Group Promote</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Convert From</code> to <code>Auto</code> to <code>Points</code>

<li>
<code>Group Name</code> to <code>extrudeSide</code>

<li>
<code>New Name</code> to <code>pin</code>

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
We'll use the group of points to tell <code>Vellum</code> to leave these where they are when inflating the balloon.
</p>

<div id="Houdini - KarmaXPU Quickstart Pt.0 - Preparing Our Geometry-Setting Up A Vellum Balloon"><h2 id="Setting Up A Vellum Balloon" class="header"><a href="#Houdini - KarmaXPU Quickstart Pt.0 - Preparing Our Geometry-Setting Up A Vellum Balloon">Setting Up A Vellum Balloon</a></h2></div>

<p>
Next we'll set up a Vellum Balloon simulation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Vellum Configure Balloon</code> network:

<ul>
<li>

<div id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ"><h2 id="FAQ" class="header"><a href="#Google NotebookLM-FAQ">FAQ</a></h2></div>

<div id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What is the primary goal of the tutorial series?_*"><h4 id="*_What is the primary goal of the tutorial series?_*" class="header"><a href="#Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What is the primary goal of the tutorial series?_*"><span id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What is the primary goal of the tutorial series?_*-<em>What is the primary goal of the tutorial series?</em>"></span><strong id="<em>What is the primary goal of the tutorial series?</em>"><em>What is the primary goal of the tutorial series?</em></strong></a></h4></div>

<p>
The primary goal of this tutorial series is to explore rendering techniques within Houdini using Karma and Karma XPU, focusing on new features in Houdini 19.5. It aims to recreate abstract artworks, initially created in Photoshop, using Houdini’s procedural tools and simulation capabilities.
</p>

<div id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_How does the geometry creation process begin in Houdini?_*"><h4 id="*_How does the geometry creation process begin in Houdini?_*" class="header"><a href="#Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_How does the geometry creation process begin in Houdini?_*"><span id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_How does the geometry creation process begin in Houdini?_*-<em>How does the geometry creation process begin in Houdini?</em>"></span><strong id="<em>How does the geometry creation process begin in Houdini?</em>"><em>How does the geometry creation process begin in Houdini?</em></strong></a></h4></div>

<p>
The process starts by creating a geometry node and diving into it. A curve node is then used in an orthogonal view to draw abstract, plant-like shapes using Bezier curves. The curves are then resampled to achieve a uniform point distribution, and a remesh node converts the curves to a uniform triangular mesh.
</p>

<div id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What techniques are employed to give the initial 2D shape a 3D appearance?_*"><h4 id="*_What techniques are employed to give the initial 2D shape a 3D appearance?_*" class="header"><a href="#Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What techniques are employed to give the initial 2D shape a 3D appearance?_*"><span id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What techniques are employed to give the initial 2D shape a 3D appearance?_*-<em>What techniques are employed to give the initial 2D shape a 3D appearance?</em>"></span><strong id="<em>What techniques are employed to give the initial 2D shape a 3D appearance?</em>"><em>What techniques are employed to give the initial 2D shape a 3D appearance?</em></strong></a></h4></div>

<p>
The initial 2D mesh is extruded using the "polyextrude" node to give it thickness, creating a 3D plate. The extrusion is kept very small (0.01 units) and then the side polygons of the extrusion are grouped.
</p>

<div id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_How is the Vellum simulation used to inflate and shape the geometry?_*"><h4 id="*_How is the Vellum simulation used to inflate and shape the geometry?_*" class="header"><a href="#Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_How is the Vellum simulation used to inflate and shape the geometry?_*"><span id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_How is the Vellum simulation used to inflate and shape the geometry?_*-<em>How is the Vellum simulation used to inflate and shape the geometry?</em>"></span><strong id="<em>How is the Vellum simulation used to inflate and shape the geometry?</em>"><em>How is the Vellum simulation used to inflate and shape the geometry?</em></strong></a></h4></div>

<p>
A Vellum Balloon constraint is employed, which configures how the surface behaves and applies pressure for inflation. Key adjustments include pinning outer points to maintain their original position using a group created from the extrusion, setting higher stiffness for cloth and pressure, and low bend stiffness to encourage wrinkling. Additionally, a high rest length scale is utilized to allow for expansion.
</p>

<div id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What modifications are made to the Vellum solver to achieve the desired simulation?_*"><h4 id="*_What modifications are made to the Vellum solver to achieve the desired simulation?_*" class="header"><a href="#Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What modifications are made to the Vellum solver to achieve the desired simulation?_*"><span id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What modifications are made to the Vellum solver to achieve the desired simulation?_*-<em>What modifications are made to the Vellum solver to achieve the desired simulation?</em>"></span><strong id="<em>What modifications are made to the Vellum solver to achieve the desired simulation?</em>"><em>What modifications are made to the Vellum solver to achieve the desired simulation?</em></strong></a></h4></div>

<p>
The Vellum solver is modified by decreasing the maximum iterations to 32, increasing substeps for each frame, and disabling gravity and wind forces. Velocity damping is used instead. Memory caching is increased to allow for more data during the simulation.
</p>

<div id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What post-processing is done after the Vellum simulation and why?_*"><h4 id="*_What post-processing is done after the Vellum simulation and why?_*" class="header"><a href="#Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What post-processing is done after the Vellum simulation and why?_*"><span id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What post-processing is done after the Vellum simulation and why?_*-<em>What post-processing is done after the Vellum simulation and why?</em>"></span><strong id="<em>What post-processing is done after the Vellum simulation and why?</em>"><em>What post-processing is done after the Vellum simulation and why?</em></strong></a></h4></div>

<p>
A Vellum post-process node is used to smooth the result with a spatial blur and to subdivide the geometry using loop subdivision. This post-processing is done to improve the visual quality by creating a smoother, higher-quality mesh.
</p>

<div id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What attributes are calculated and stored on the final geometry before rendering?_*"><h4 id="*_What attributes are calculated and stored on the final geometry before rendering?_*" class="header"><a href="#Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What attributes are calculated and stored on the final geometry before rendering?_*"><span id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What attributes are calculated and stored on the final geometry before rendering?_*-<em>What attributes are calculated and stored on the final geometry before rendering?</em>"></span><strong id="<em>What attributes are calculated and stored on the final geometry before rendering?</em>"><em>What attributes are calculated and stored on the final geometry before rendering?</em></strong></a></h4></div>

<p>
A measure node is used to calculate and store the curvature of the geometry on points, and then a normal node calculates point normals for use in shading. These attributes are crucial for controlling shading and rendering in Karma.
</p>

<div id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What is the significance of the final 'out' null node in the scene?_*"><h4 id="*_What is the significance of the final 'out' null node in the scene?_*" class="header"><a href="#Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What is the significance of the final 'out' null node in the scene?_*"><span id="Google NotebookLM-FAQ-*_What is the significance of the final 'out' null node in the scene?_*-<em>What is the significance of the final 'out' null node in the scene?</em>"></span><strong id="<em>What is the significance of the final 'out' null node in the scene?</em>"><em>What is the significance of the final 'out' null node in the scene?</em></strong></a></h4></div>

<p>
The final 'out' null node serves as a clean output point for the geometry. This allows for easy selection of the final geometry which can then be shaded, lit, and rendered in Karma for visualization, using the attributes that have been calculated in the previous steps.
</p>

<p>
The process begins with a geometry node, and then uses a curve node to draw the base shapes in an orthographic view, leveraging the auto draw mode for smooth curves.
The curve is then resampled using a resample node to create uniformly spaced points for further manipulation, setting length between points to 0.01.
</p>

<p>
The curve is then remeshed into a uniform triangle mesh with the remesh node, with the mesh target size set to 0.01. The iterations are increased to 6 to achieve a more even mesh.
A polyextrude node is used to give the mesh a small amount of thickness (0.01), also adding back faces to create a closed geometry.
The side faces from the extrusion are then placed into a group using the “output side group” option of the polyextrude node. This extrude side group is then promoted into a point group called "pin" with group promote.

<p>
A vellum balloon constraint is added to simulate an inflating balloon. The points on the perimeter (the "pin" group) are pinned to their original locations using the pin to animation setting in the cloth constraints.
The stretch stiffness of the Vellum cloth is increased to 6 * 10000 while the rest length scale is increased to 1.2 to allow for expansion. Bend stiffness is decreased to allow for wrinkling.
The pressure is then configured within the vellum pressure node by increasing the stiffness to 6 * 1000000 and the rest length scale to 12.
</p>

<p>
A vellum solver is used to execute the simulation by setting a few tweaks. The max iterations are set to 32, the substeps are increased to 2 and gravity and wind are disabled.
