<p>
Aperture shapes play a crucial role in how bright areas of an image appear when defocused, particularly in bokeh effects and lens blur simulations.
</p>

<div id="Aperture Shape and Defocus-How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights"><h2 id="How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights" class="header"><a href="#Aperture Shape and Defocus-How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights">How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights</a></h2></div>

<p>
When an image contains bright points of light (such as streetlights or reflections), and the camera lens is out of focus, these points expand into blurred circles or other shapes. The shape of these defocused highlights is determined by the aperture blades inside the lens.

<div id="Aperture Shape and Defocus-How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights-Circular Aperture (Ideal Case)"><h4 id="Circular Aperture (Ideal Case)" class="header"><a href="#Aperture Shape and Defocus-How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights-Circular Aperture (Ideal Case)">Circular Aperture (Ideal Case)</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
A perfectly round aperture produces smooth, circular bokeh.

<li>
This is common in high-end lenses with well-designed aperture blades.

</ul>

<div id="Aperture Shape and Defocus-How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights-Polygonal Aperture (Real-World Case)"><h4 id="Polygonal Aperture (Real-World Case)" class="header"><a href="#Aperture Shape and Defocus-How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights-Polygonal Aperture (Real-World Case)">Polygonal Aperture (Real-World Case)</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Most camera lenses have 5 to 9 aperture blades, forming a pentagon, hexagon, or octagon when stopped down.

<li>
This results in polygonal-shaped bokeh instead of perfect circles.

</ul>

<div id="Aperture Shape and Defocus-How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights-Custom Aperture Shapes (Creative Effects)"><h4 id="Custom Aperture Shapes (Creative Effects)" class="header"><a href="#Aperture Shape and Defocus-How Aperture Shapes Affect Defocused Highlights-Custom Aperture Shapes (Creative Effects)">Custom Aperture Shapes (Creative Effects)</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Some photographers use cut-out aperture masks to create heart-shaped, star-shaped, or other artistic bokeh.

<li>
This technique is often used in creative photography.

<p>
In Nuke, BlinkScript, and other compositing tools, aperture shapes can be simulated using convolution kernels or blur algorithms.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Lens Blur Nodes

<ul>
<li>
Many compositing software packages allow users to define aperture shapes when applying blur effects.

<li>
In Nuke, the ZDefocus node lets you choose between circular, polygonal, or custom aperture shapes.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
BlinkScript for Custom Aperture Effects

<ul>
<li>
BlinkScript can be used to simulate real-world lens blur by applying a kernel-based blur with a specific aperture shape.

<li>
This is useful for film-style defocusing effects.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Defocus &amp; Bloom Effects

<ul>
<li>
Bright areas of an image can be expanded using glow and bloom effects, mimicking how light scatters in a real lens.

<li>
This is often combined with aperture-based blur for realistic results.

</ul>
</ul>
