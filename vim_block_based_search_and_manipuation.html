<p>
Below is an overview of ways you can use Vim's scripting and its built‐in commands to analyze, extract, or manipulate multi‐line blocks in a file—such as Nuke scripts—based on node classes or names. These techniques work on any structured text, and you can tailor them to your file’s format.
</p>

<div id="Working With Structured Scripts-Using Global Commands and Regex"><h3 id="Using Global Commands and Regex" class="header"><a href="#Working With Structured Scripts-Using Global Commands and Regex">Using Global Commands and Regex</a></h3></div>

<p>
If your Nuke script uses a block–based format (for example, blocks that begin with a keyword like <code>Read {</code> and end with <code>}</code>), you can use Vim’s global (<code>:g</code>) command with a regular expression to jump to and work with those blocks.
</p>

<div id="Working With Structured Scripts-Using Global Commands and Regex-Example: Marking Blocks"><h4 id="Example: Marking Blocks" class="header"><a href="#Working With Structured Scripts-Using Global Commands and Regex-Example: Marking Blocks">Example: Marking Blocks</a></h4></div>

<p>
For instance, suppose your Nuke script contains:
</p>

<pre nuke>
Read {
  name "Read1"
  file "/path/to/file1.exr"
}

Write {
  name "Write1"
  file "/output/path/out.exr"
}
</pre>

<p>
You might want to quickly find all <code>Read</code> blocks. While Vim’s single-line regular expressions don’t naturally span multiple lines, you can first navigate to the starting lines with:
</p>

<pre vim>
:g/^Read\s*{/ normal! V/^\s*}\&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This command does the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>:g/^Read\s*{/</code> runs a command on every line that starts a Read <code>{</code> block.

<li>
For each such line, <code>normal! V</code> enters Visual Line mode to select the current line.

<li>
Then <code>/^\s*}\&lt;CR&gt;</code> searches downwards for a line that contains only a closing brace (<code>}</code>), effectively extending the selection to the end of the block.

</ul>
<p>
You could then, for instance, yank that whole visual selection or even pipe it into another command. (Note: For more advanced multi-line matching, Vim’s pattern syntax could be extended using <code>\_</code> constructs, but many users prefer a script-based approach for clarity.)
</p>

<div id="Working With Structured Scripts-Writing a Vimscript Function to Extract Blocks"><h3 id="Writing a Vimscript Function to Extract Blocks" class="header"><a href="#Working With Structured Scripts-Writing a Vimscript Function to Extract Blocks">Writing a Vimscript Function to Extract Blocks</a></h3></div>

<p>
For more flexible manipulation—and to work with longer paths or nested information—you can write a Vimscript function. For example, the following function examines the current buffer for blocks starting with a given node class (like <code>"Read"</code>) and collects the block’s contents as a single string:
</p>

<pre vim>
function! ExtractNukeBlocks(className)
  " List to hold extracted blocks
  let blocks = []
  let currentBlock = []
  let inBlock = 0

  " Build a pattern for the block start.
  " For example, if className is "Read", pattern becomes '^Read\s*{'
  let pattern = '^' . a:className . '\s*{'

  " Iterate over every line in the buffer
  for line in getline(1, '$')
    " If a line matches the block start pattern, start a new block.
    if line =~ pattern
      let inBlock = 1
      let currentBlock = [line]
      continue
    endif

    " If we're inside a block, append the line.
    if inBlock
      call add(currentBlock, line)
      " Check for the block ending.
      if line =~ '^\s*}\s*$'
        let inBlock = 0
        " Join the block into a single string and add it to blocks.
        call add(blocks, join(currentBlock, "\n"))
        let currentBlock = []
      endif
    endif
  endfor

  " Optionally, display the blocks (or process them as needed).
  for block in blocks
    echo "Block found:"
    echo block
    echo "----------------"
  endfor

  " Return the list of blocks (could be used for further processing)
  return blocks
endfunction
</pre>

<div id="Working With Structured Scripts-Writing a Vimscript Function to Extract Blocks-How This Function Works"><h4 id="How This Function Works" class="header"><a href="#Working With Structured Scripts-Writing a Vimscript Function to Extract Blocks-How This Function Works">How This Function Works</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Set Up and Pattern Matching:

<ul>
<li>
It takes a parameter like <code>"Read"</code> or <code>"Write"</code> and constructs a regexp to find lines that begin with that class followed by an opening curly brace.

</ul>
<li>
Iterating Over Lines:

<ul>
<li>
It loops through every line (<code>getline(1, '$')</code> returns all lines in the buffer).

<li>
When it finds a line matching the start of a block, it begins accumulating lines.

</ul>
<li>
Detecting the End of a Block:

<ul>
<li>
The function looks for a line that contains only a closing brace (<code>^\s*}\s*$</code>) as the end marker.

</ul>
<li>
Collecting and Processing:

<ul>
<li>
When a block is closed, the accumulated lines are joined and stored.

<li>
Finally, it displays (or returns) the blocks for further processing.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
To extract all <code>Read</code> blocks, for example, open your Nuke script in Vim and then run:
</p>

<pre vim>
:call ExtractNukeBlocks("Read")
</pre>

<p>
You can easily modify the function to search for blocks based on a node's name (by further scanning the contents for a line like <code>name "Read1"</code> and then storing that as metadata), or to work recursively for nested blocks if needed.

<p>
Vim supports “very magic” patterns and a special newline matcher (<code>\_</code>) that can allow patterns to span multiple lines. For example, to match an entire block from <code>Read {</code> to the next isolated <code>}</code>, you might try something like:
</p>

<pre vim>
:%s/\(Read\s*{\_.*\n\?.*}\)/[Extracted: \1]/g
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Here, <code>\_.*</code> tells Vim to match any character including newlines.

<li>
This approach is less intuitive and generally works best when the block structure is simple and predictable.

</ul>

<p>
Once you’ve extracted or identified blocks, you might want to process them further. You could populate Vim’s quickfix list with matching blocks or errors if your analysis finds a problem within a node definition. For example:
</p>

<pre vim>
:vimgrep /Read\s*{/ %  " Search for lines starting with "Read {"
:copen
</pre>

<p>
This command finds all starting lines for <code>Read</code> blocks, puts them in the quickfix list, and opens the window so you can quickly jump to each occurrence.
</p>

<p>
Vim is very powerful for analyzing multiple lines—even complex blocks—in files like Nuke scripts. You can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use global commands and regular expressions to jump to or operate on such blocks.

<li>
Write a custom Vimscript function that loops through the file, detects block boundaries, and then extracts or processes the block content.

<li>
Leverage multi-line regex capabilities with constructs like <code>\_.*</code> when the structure is predictable.

<li>
Integrate with Vim's quickfix system for fast navigation between multiple blocks.

</ul>
<p>
This flexibility means you can adapt Vim to serve as a lightweight parser or analyzer for your project-specific files.
