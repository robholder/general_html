<p>
Below is an overview of ways you can use Vim's scripting and its built‐in commands to analyze, extract, or manipulate multi‐line blocks in a file—such as Nuke scripts—based on node classes or names. These techniques work on any structured text, and you can tailor them to your file’s format.
</p>


<p>
Here is a fake Nuke script with some definition blocks:
</p>

<pre nuke>
Read {
  name "Read1"
  file "/path/to/file1.exr"
}

Write {
  name "Write1"
  file "/output/path/out.exr"
}
</pre>

<p>
To reliably select an entire block (from the starting pattern to the closing brace on its own line), you can write a Vimscript function that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Finds the start line.

<li>
Searches for the next line matching the end pattern.

<li>
Manually sets the visual selection marks to cover the desired range.

</ul>
<p>
Here’s one way to do it:
</p>
<pre vim>
function! VisualSelectBlock()
  " Record the starting line number.
  let start_line = line('.')
  " Search forward for a line that contains only a closing brace.
  let end_line = search('^\s*}\s*$', 'W')
  " If we found a closing brace after the start line...
  if end_line &gt; start_line
    " Set the beginning and end marks for the Visual selection.
    call setpos("'&lt;", [0, start_line, 1, 0])
    call setpos("'&gt;", [0, end_line, 1, 0])
    " Re-select the visual block from the marks.
    normal! gv
  else
    echo "Closing brace not found."
  endif
endfunction
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Determine Range: Using <code>line('.')</code> gets the current line number (which should be the <code>Read {</code> line). Then <code>search('^\s*}\s*$', 'W')</code> looks for a line that, possibly after some whitespace, contains only a closing brace—in the whole file.

<li>
Setting Visual Marks: The function uses <code>setpos("'&lt;", [0, start_line, 1, 0])</code> and <code>setpos("'&gt;", [0, end_line, 1, 0])</code> to define the start and end of the Visual selection.

<li>
Re-selecting: Finally, <code>normal! gv</code> re-selects the text that lies between those marks, effectively highlighting the entire block.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Place your cursor on a line that starts with <code>Read {</code>.

<li>
Execute the function with:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:call VisualSelectBlock()
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
The entire block — from the <code>Read {</code> line down to its matching closing <code>}</code> — should now be visually selected.

</ul>

<p>
This technique can be expanded further. For example, you could:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Extract Blocks to a Variable: Instead of merely selecting, you could loop over lines (using <code>getline(start_line, end_line)</code>) and process or modify the block.

<li>
Work on Subdirectories or Complex Paths: Just as we analyzed file paths earlier, you can further refine the selection logic by inspecting and manipulating blocks based on the contents of those lines (like node names or classes in Nuke scripts).

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The original one-liner doesn’t work as intended because the search in Visual mode doesn’t extend the selection.

<li>
A custom function that uses Vim’s internal marks to define a block is a more reliable approach.

<li>
Once you’ve mastered selecting text blocks, you can analyze or modify them programmatically—ideal for working with something like Nuke scripts where you might need to extract and process blocks based on node classes or names.

</ul>

<p>
For more flexible manipulation—and to work with longer paths or nested information—you can write a Vimscript function. For example, the following function examines the current buffer for blocks starting with a given node class (like <code>"Read"</code>) and collects the block’s contents as a single string:
</p>

<pre vim>
function! ExtractNukeBlocks(className)
  " List to hold extracted blocks
  let blocks = []
  let currentBlock = []
  let inBlock = 0

  " Build a pattern for the block start.
  " For example, if className is "Read", pattern becomes '^Read\s*{'
  let pattern = '^' . a:className . '\s*{'

  " Iterate over every line in the buffer
  for line in getline(1, '$')
    " If a line matches the block start pattern, start a new block.
    if line =~ pattern
      let inBlock = 1
      let currentBlock = [line]
      continue
    endif

    " If we're inside a block, append the line.
    if inBlock
      call add(currentBlock, line)
      " Check for the block ending.
      if line =~ '^\s*}\s*$'
        let inBlock = 0
        " Join the block into a single string and add it to blocks.
        call add(blocks, join(currentBlock, "\n"))
        let currentBlock = []
      endif
    endif
  endfor

  " Optionally, display the blocks (or process them as needed).
  for block in blocks
    echo "Block found:"
    echo block
    echo "----------------"
  endfor

  " Return the list of blocks (could be used for further processing)
  return blocks
endfunction
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Set Up and Pattern Matching:

<ul>
<li>
It takes a parameter like <code>"Read"</code> or <code>"Write"</code> and constructs a regexp to find lines that begin with that class followed by an opening curly brace.

</ul>
<li>
Iterating Over Lines:

<ul>
<li>
It loops through every line (<code>getline(1, '$')</code> returns all lines in the buffer).

<li>
When it finds a line matching the start of a block, it begins accumulating lines.

</ul>
<li>
Detecting the End of a Block:

<ul>
<li>
The function looks for a line that contains only a closing brace (<code>^\s*}\s*$</code>) as the end marker.

</ul>
<li>
Collecting and Processing:

<ul>
<li>
When a block is closed, the accumulated lines are joined and stored.

<li>
Finally, it displays (or returns) the blocks for further processing.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
To extract all <code>Read</code> blocks, for example, open your Nuke script in Vim and then run:
</p>

<pre vim>
:call ExtractNukeBlocks("Read")
</pre>

<p>
You can easily modify the function to search for blocks based on a node's name (by further scanning the contents for a line like <code>name "Read1"</code> and then storing that as metadata), or to work recursively for nested blocks if needed.

<p>
Vim supports “very magic” patterns and a special newline matcher (<code>\_</code>) that can allow patterns to span multiple lines. For example, to match an entire block from <code>Read {</code> to the next isolated <code>}</code>, you might try something like:
</p>

<pre vim>
:%s/\(Read\s*{\_.*\n\?.*}\)/[Extracted: \1]/g
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Here, <code>\_.*</code> tells Vim to match any character including newlines.

<li>
This approach is less intuitive and generally works best when the block structure is simple and predictable.

</ul>

<p>
Once you’ve extracted or identified blocks, you might want to process them further. You could populate Vim’s quickfix list with matching blocks or errors if your analysis finds a problem within a node definition. For example:
</p>

<pre vim>
:vimgrep /Read\s*{/ %  " Search for lines starting with "Read {"
:copen
</pre>

<p>
This command finds all starting lines for <code>Read</code> blocks, puts them in the quickfix list, and opens the window so you can quickly jump to each occurrence.
</p>
 
<div id="Advanced Techniques-Conclusion"><h3 id="Conclusion" class="header"><a href="#Advanced Techniques-Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></div>

<p>
Vim is very powerful for analyzing multiple lines—even complex blocks—in files like Nuke scripts. You can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use global commands and regular expressions to jump to or operate on such blocks.

<li>
Write a custom Vimscript function that loops through the file, detects block boundaries, and then extracts or processes the block content.

<li>
Leverage multi-line regex capabilities with constructs like <code>\_.*</code> when the structure is predictable.

<li>
Integrate with Vim's quickfix system for fast navigation between multiple blocks.

</ul>
<p>
This flexibility means you can adapt Vim to serve as a lightweight parser or analyzer for your project-specific files.
