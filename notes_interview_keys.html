What's the best way to enhance my LinkedIn profile. I feel like my brief description of my professional experience and abilities are very generic and uninspiring. 
</p>

<p>
This is what I have:
</p>

<p>
<span id="Link edIn Discussion-QUESTION-<em>&quot;Over two decades of experience working at the very top levels of CG and VFX, with the extensive experience of creating imagery for numerous top-grossing feature films, commercials, advertising projects, TV series and TV specials.&quot;</em>"></span><strong id="<em>&quot;Over two decades of experience working at the very top levels of CG and VFX, with the extensive experience of creating imagery for numerous top-grossing feature films, commercials, advertising projects, TV series and TV specials.&quot;</em>"><em>"Over two decades of experience working at the very top levels of CG and VFX, with the extensive experience of creating imagery for numerous top-grossing feature films, commercials, advertising projects, TV series and TV specials."</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
I have around 35 credits, mostly high grossing movies, and lately, I've been contributing a lot to technical development in Nuke, Houdini and Maya, using Python and tooling within packages.
</p>

<p>
I am firmly in the 'artist' camp when it comes to role, but I have a very valuable skill in being able to augment pipelines with custom tools to anhance artistic goals and efficiency for fellow artists on projects.
</p>

<p>
How can I stress my experience, my artistic track-record of world class lighting and compositing, and my unique skills as an artist to produce technical backup to the productions I work on.

If none exist, consider writing a LinkedIn article about “How artistry and technical innovation intersect in modern VFX.”

</ul>
<li>
Awards / Recognition

<ul>
