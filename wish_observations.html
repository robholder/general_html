<div id="Show Specific Issues"><h1 id="Show Specific Issues" class="header"><a href="#Show Specific Issues">Show Specific Issues</a></h1></div>

<div id="Show Specific Issues-Bubbles Different in each shot"><h2 id="Bubbles Different in each shot" class="header"><a href="#Show Specific Issues-Bubbles Different in each shot">Bubbles Different in each shot</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
All elements arrive as procedural shader emissions (there are no 'lighter' added elements - no lighting added by Lighters), however:

<ul>
<li>
Even when using the same Nuke scripts the bubbles look different in each shot

<li>
To compound this already 'not ideal' situation:

<ul>
<li>
Every team treats these common procedural elements differently

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
I have kept an extensive prescriptive recipe (as it changes) to be able to render/composite/deliver bubbles, which is neither efficient nor consistent. This drains my time, and although I've been able to share my efforts amongst artist, this workflow is surely not desirable.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Key shots are constantly changed, developed and tweaked (even to the last week of production):

<ul>
<li>
DLight - numerous MOD changes (incremental and spontaneous)

<li>
Nuke - each shot seems to demand unique and numerous changes EVEN to approach homogeneity

<li>
There doesn't seem to be any coordinated way of disseminating tweaks and changes, other than inefficient and accident-prone 'word of mouth'.

<li>
Either:

<ul>
<li>
Look-dev should be in a reasonable status before implementation and/or

<li>
Scriptable updates should be considered (to assess a file and populate with changes/updates as needed

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Show Specific Issues-Continuity"><h2 id="Continuity" class="header"><a href="#Show Specific Issues-Continuity">Continuity</a></h2></div>

<p>
There has been a lack of direction in keeping shots within the boundaries of continuity, proving challenging for temp artists:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
As a 10 week artist, bringing "in between" shots to final has been hindered by goals that fall between disparate key-shots.

<li>
Continuity of techniques also hinders efficient delivery.

</ul>

<div id="Show Specific Issues-Production Coordination"><h2 id="Production Coordination" class="header"><a href="#Show Specific Issues-Production Coordination">Production Coordination</a></h2></div>

<p>
For the first time at Disney, Shotgrid has served as a vague reflection of current circumstances, NOT as a prescriptive and informative resource:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tasks are reported to coordinators by artists, rather than artists being directed by coordinators to achieve goals

<li>
Production (and Shotgrid) is following rather than projection, planning or serving as an accurate resource of current status.

<li>
I keep my own extensive planner to keep track of:

<ul>
<li>
Other departments' status and expected delivery dates.

<li>
My own status per shot

<li>
Keeping accurate (and current) shot notes

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="General Issues"><h1 id="General Issues" class="header"><a href="#General Issues">General Issues</a></h1></div>
<div id="General Issues-Shot Content Control"><h2 id="Shot Content Control" class="header"><a href="#General Issues-Shot Content Control">Shot Content Control</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
It seems that shots can be shown for review, yet obvious omissions or additions from upstream departments are often missed until way down the trail.

<li>
DLight seems to de-activate elements randomly, resulting in the archaeological technique of digging through upstream department publishes in DPix to compare results.

<li>
While a review of upstream departments' deliveries is obviously good practice, the disparity of 22 bubbles instead of the intended 24 bubbles seems to be inefficient and prone to preventable errors.

<li>
In the past, there were more department representatives watching for disparity at reviews.

</ul>

<div id="General Issues-Shot Content Control-SetExt"><h4 id="SetExt" class="header"><a href="#General Issues-Shot Content Control-SetExt">SetExt</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
I had multiple conversations on multiple shots, involving me searching the server for file timestamps to establish why my setExt elements weren't correct, and multiple times for each shot.

</ul>

<div id="General Issues-Shot Content Control-FX"><h4 id="FX" class="header"><a href="#General Issues-Shot Content Control-FX">FX</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
DLight seems to randomly set FX assets to a state of not 'activated' or 'do not render'.

<li>
Also, some FX elements are delivered to USD, even though they should be turned off in the final shot

</ul>


<div id="General Issues-Technical Workflow and Template Errors"><h2 id="Technical Workflow and Template Errors" class="header"><a href="#General Issues-Technical Workflow and Template Errors">Technical Workflow and Template Errors</a></h2></div>

<p>
Even though the Nuke scripts for WISH have been a remarkable achievement in Look-dev and a joy to use, there are still numerous technical errors and bad-practice that have created minor but ubiquitous flaws in the finished shots.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bad edges:

<ul>
<li>
Unpremult/Premult issues in the published templates:

<ul>
<li>
Rules such as unpremult for color, premult for filters are not consistently observed

</ul>
<li>
Premultiplied mattes being used with premultiplied images/layers:

<ul>
<li>
The artifacts from these minor errors are visible in many shots, and I wonder if they have become 'accepted' since they are common.

</ul>
<li>
Use of aliased Depth passes as color passes.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="General Issues-Lack of Automation"><h2 id="Lack of Automation" class="header"><a href="#General Issues-Lack of Automation">Lack of Automation</a></h2></div>

<p>
While there are many wonderful tools in use (and in permanent development and improvement), I feel there isn't enough engagement with automation (and a lack of cultural awareness of standardization for scripting). This would cover naming, formatting and tagging of created elements. Sometimes there is a sense of entropy, as established standards fall and erode.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Scripting could be embraced more (culturally) to accelerate and disseminate repetitive or precise changes. 

<li>
When an artist-level scripts appear in ShadowBox, they seem to be used and embraced 'en masse', and on the whole save hundreds of hours with each publish, yet there doesn't seem a culture that values these additions. There is so much more that could be achieved in efficiency (time and aesthetically).

<li>
Scripts at artist level (as a complement to the solid pipeline) could (and should) be saving time and allowing for more refined and consistent results.

</ul>

<div id="General Issues-Email Subject Formatting (for Show/Seq/Shot):"><h2 id="Email Subject Formatting (for Show/Seq/Shot):" class="header"><a href="#General Issues-Email Subject Formatting (for Show/Seq/Shot):">Email Subject Formatting (for Show/Seq/Shot):</a></h2></div>

<p>
This item perhaps illustrates a lack of understanding of the benefits of standardization.
</p>

<p>
Artists get countless emails, especially from Shotgrid:
</p>

<p>
With emails for every trigger or change for a shot, it is vital to have the ability to 'filter' emails accurately and consistantly. This makes each email a valuable resource, and provides an intuitive visual guide to what's going on, just by observing 'unread' emails as they arrive in shot specific folder (or Labels).
</p>

<p>
I remember on my first project experience at Disney, there were a few occasions when a Shotgrid email would appear that didn't comply to a common format for show/seq/shot etc.
A friendly nudge via email or Slack message from a user would result in the format being refined or corrected.
</p>

<p>
This has been neglected over the years, and now even though I have my own automated filter creation script for GMail, I've largely given up trying to cover the numerous and random changes to the simple categories of show/seq/shot.
</p>

<p>
Too much unrefined email becomes a barrage of (ignored and useless) noise.
