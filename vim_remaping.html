Let's take a deep dive into Vim’s mapping commands and how their names encode both the mode in which they operate and the nature of the mapping (i.e., whether it’s recursive or not). This understanding not only demystifies the commands but also empowers you to tailor Vim exactly to your preferences.
Below is a thorough breakdown of the mapping commands, along with a brief background on Vim's mode letters.

<ul>
<li>
<code>map</code>

<ul>
<li>
What It Is: A command to create a mapping that, by default, applies to normal, visual, select, and operator-pending modes.

<li>
Nature: Recursive. This means that if the right-hand side of the mapping contains keys that have their own mappings, Vim will further expand them.

</ul>
<li>
<code>remap</code>

<ul>
<li>
What It Is: Although you might not find a separate command literally called <code>remap</code> in <code>:help</code>, the term “remap” is commonly used to reference the process of mapping keys recursively.

<li>
Nature: It implies that the mapping is recursive. In other words, Vim will check for further mappings when executing the sequence assigned to a key.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Vim lets you restrict mappings to specific modes. Let’s break down a few:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>nmap</code>

<ul>
<li>
Mode: Normal mode only (indicated by the leading <code>n</code>).

<li>
Nature: Recursive. Keys on the right-hand side will be subject to further mapping expansion.

</ul>
<li>
<code>noremap</code>

<ul>
<li>
What It Is: A generic command that creates a non-recursive mapping by default. When you use <code>noremap</code> (without any mode letter), it applies to normal, visual, select, and operator-pending modes.

<li>
Nature: Non-recursive. The right-hand side is taken literally so that any mapping that might be associated with those keys is ignored. This prevents unwanted side effects or infinite loops.

</ul>
<li>
<code>nnoremap</code>

<ul>
<li>
Mode: Normal mode only (<code>n</code> stands for normal).

<li>
Nature: Non-recursive mapping. This is ideal when you want a mapping in normal mode that won’t trigger any other mapping that might have been defined for its output sequence.

</ul>
<li>
Example:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
nnoremap Y y$
</pre>

<p>
This maps <code>Y</code> to yank to the end of a line, regardless of any mapping that might be defined for <code>y</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
inoremap

<ul>
<li>
Mode: Insert mode only (<code>i</code> stands for insert).

<li>
Nature: Non-recursive mapping. Useful for custom shortcuts while editing text.

<li>
Example:

</ul>
</ul>
  
<pre vim>
inoremap jj &lt;Esc&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Typing <code>jj</code> in insert mode immediately acts as an escape, taking you back to normal mode.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>vnoremap</code>

<ul>
<li>
Mode: Visual mode (and select mode, since the <code>v</code> mapping generally covers both visual and select).

<li>
Nature: Non-recursive mapping.

<li>
Example:

</ul>
</ul>
  
<pre vim>
vnoremap &lt;leader&gt;c :CommentToggle&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This lets you trigger a comment toggle on the selected text without interference from any other mappings.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>vmap</code>

<ul>
<li>
Mode: Visual (and select) mode only.

<li>
Nature: Recursive mapping.

<li>
It works just like <code>nmap</code> does for normal mode but is limited to when you are in visual mode.

</ul>
<li>
<code>xmap</code>

<ul>
<li>
Mode: Visual mode only—strictly visual, excluding other similar modes like select mode.

<li>
Nature: Recursive mapping.

<li>
Use this when you need a mapping to be active only during visual selections.

</ul>
<li>
<code>xnoremap</code>

<ul>
<li>
Mode: Visual mode only (the <code>x</code> stands for visual mode exclusively).

<li>
Nature: Non-recursive mapping.

<li>
This is a stricter variant when you want to avoid any further remapping when keys are output in visual mode.

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Copilot's Notes on Remapping-Mapping Commands Breakdown-Mode Letters in Vim Mappings"><h3 id="Mode Letters in Vim Mappings" class="header"><a href="#Copilot's Notes on Remapping-Mapping Commands Breakdown-Mode Letters in Vim Mappings">Mode Letters in Vim Mappings</a></h3></div>

<p>
Understanding Vim’s mode letters is crucial because they define the context in which your mapping applies. Here’s a quick reference:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>n</code>: normal only

<ul>
<li>
Commands like <code>nmap</code> or <code>nnoremap</code> work only in normal mode.

</ul>
<li>
<code>v</code>: visual and select

<ul>
<li>
Commands prefixed with <code>v</code> (e.g., <code>vmap</code>, <code>vnoremap</code>) take effect when you’re in visual mode and usually extend to select mode as well.

</ul>
<li>
<code>o</code>: operator-pending

<ul>
<li>
These modes (e.g., <code>omap</code>/<code>onoremap</code>) activate when an operator (like <code>d</code> for delete or <code>y</code> for yank) is waiting for a motion.

</ul>
<li>
<code>x</code>: visual only

<ul>
<li>
The <code>x</code> prefix ensures the mapping applies strictly when you’re in visual mode (excluding select mode). <code>xmap</code> and <code>xnoremap</code> are examples here.

</ul>
<li>
<code>s</code>: select only

<ul>
<li>
Mappings with <code>s</code> as the prefix target only select mode. (Not covered in our list but useful to know.)

</ul>
<li>
<code>i</code>: insert

<ul>
<li>
Insert mode mappings (<code>inoremap</code>, <code>imap</code>) are active only while you’re inserting text.

</ul>
<li>
<code>c</code>: command-line

<ul>
<li>
These mappings (like <code>cmap</code>, <code>cnoremap</code>) apply when you’re entering a command after pressing <code>:</code>.

</ul>
<li>
<code>l</code>: Lang-Arg (or “Language Argument”)

<ul>
<li>
This pseudo-mode applies to a mix of contexts such as insert mode, command-line mode, and regular expression search. It’s particularly useful for mapping keys in multi-language input setups.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Recursive vs. Non-Recursive: Recursive mappings (without the <code>nore</code> prefix) allow further expansions; while powerful, they can lead to unexpected behaviors if a mapped key sequence is itself subject to another mapping. Non-recursive mappings (with the <code>nore</code> prefix) avoid this by using the defined sequence literally, making your configuration more predictable.

<li>
Mode Specificity: By choosing the appropriate mode letter, you ensure that your mappings only affect the parts of Vim you intend—whether you're in normal mode navigating, in visual mode selecting text, or in insert mode writing code.

</ul>
<p>
This structured approach gives you both precision and control over your key bindings, enhancing your Vim experience and making your workflow as smooth as possible.
