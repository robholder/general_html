<div id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables"><h1 id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables" class="header"><a href="#Custom Config Based on Environment Variables">Custom Config Based on Environment Variables</a></h1></div>

<p>
You can achieve behavior similar to “sourcing” an extra configuration by using Nuke’s startup scripting system. Although Nuke always runs an <code>init.py</code>  (and for interactive sessions, a menu.py) from its plugin paths, you can conditionally load extra configuration depending on how you launch Nuke. Here are a few common approaches:
</p>

<div id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Environment Variables in Your init.py"><h2 id="Using Environment Variables in Your init.py" class="header"><a href="#Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Environment Variables in Your init.py">Using Environment Variables in Your init.py</a></h2></div>

<p>
You can keep a “vanilla” <code>init.py</code>  in your default <code>~/.nuke</code> folder that conditionally loads additional configuration when a certain environment variable is set. For instance, you might write your <code>~/.nuke/init.py</code> like this:
</p>

<pre python>
import os
import nuke

# Check for an environment variable that indicates extra configuration should be loaded
if os.environ.get("NUKE_EXTRA_CONFIG") == "1":
    # Option A: Automatically import a module that sets up extra configuration
    import my_custom_config  # This module could load extra modules, set knob defaults, add menus, etc.
    
    # Option B: Alternatively, extend the plugin path so Nuke picks up a custom init.py/menu.py in another directory
    custom_path = os.path.join(os.environ["HOME"], ".nuke", "custom")
    nuke.pluginAddPath(custom_path)
</pre>

<p>
Now, when you launch Nuke from the command line with the environment variable set:
</p>

<pre bash>
export NUKE_EXTRA_CONFIG=1
/Applications/Nuke11.3v5/Nuke11.3.app/Contents/MacOS/Nuke
</pre>

<p>
…the extra configuration in <code>my_custom_config</code> (or in the custom plugin path) is loaded. Without setting <code>NUKE_EXTRA_CONFIG</code>, Nuke will start in its vanilla state.
</p>

<div id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings"><h2 id="Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings" class="header"><a href="#Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings">Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings</a></h2></div>

<p>
Nuke looks for its startup scripts (init.py and menu.py) in directories specified by the NUKE_PATH environment variable. You can organize your configuration into separate directories and then launch Nuke with a customized NUKE_PATH.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose you have two directories:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>~/.nuke/vanilla</code> – contains the default startup scripts.

<li>
<code>~/.nuke/custom</code> – contains additional configuration (custom init.py, menu.py, and modules).

</ul>
<p>
You can launch the vanilla session by leaving NUKE_PATH as is (or pointing it to the vanilla directory), and for the custom configuration, use a shell wrapper like:
</p>

<pre bash>
export NUKE_PATH="$HOME/.nuke/custom:$HOME/.nuke/vanilla"
/Applications/Nuke11.3v5/Nuke11.3.app/Contents/MacOS/Nuke
</pre>

<p>
This way, the custom directory is given priority in the plugin search path, and its startup scripts will be picked up.
</p>

<div id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings-More on NUKE_PATH"><h3 id="More on NUKE_PATH" class="header"><a href="#Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings-More on NUKE_PATH">More on NUKE_PATH</a></h3></div>

<p>
Nuke handles files in the NUKE_PATH in two different ways depending on what you’re loading:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings-More on NUKE_PATH-Startup Scripts (init.py and menu.py)"></span><strong id="Startup Scripts (init.py and menu.py)">Startup Scripts (init.py and menu.py)</strong>: Nuke doesn’t stop after finding just one copy. In fact, it scans all the directories listed in your NUKE_PATH (in reverse order) and executes every <code>init.py</code>  (and <code>menu.py</code>) it finds. So if you set
<pre sh>
export NUKE_PATH="$HOME/.nuke/custom:$HOME/.nuke/vanilla"
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
Nuke will load both the startup scripts in your custom directory as well as those in vanilla. Typically, the custom scripts are used to override or add to the settings from vanilla. In essence, it layers the configurations rather than stopping after loading the first one.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings-More on NUKE_PATH-Plugins and Modules"></span><strong id="Plugins and Modules">Plugins and Modules</strong>: When it comes to loading individual plugins or modules (for example, gizmos, custom nodes, etc.), Nuke searches the NUKE_PATH in order (again, effectively in reverse priority). It will use the first instance it finds; if the same-named plugin exists in both custom and vanilla, the one in the higher-priority directory (in your case, appearing first in the reversed order, which is your custom directory) will be used. This allows you to override a vanilla plugin simply by placing your version in the custom folder.

</ul>
<div id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings-More on NUKE_PATH-In summary:"><h4 id="In summary:" class="header"><a href="#Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Using Different NUKE_PATH Settings-More on NUKE_PATH-In summary:">In summary:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Setting your NUKE_PATH as above does not make Nuke “stop” importing right after the custom <code>init.py</code>.

<li>
Instead, for startup scripts, it loads all of them (with later ones overriding earlier settings), and for plugins, it uses the first match it finds in the priority order. This is a common and effective strategy to customize your Nuke environment while still retaining a fallback “vanilla” configuration.

</ul>
<div id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Comparing with Shell Sourcing"><h2 id="Comparing with Shell Sourcing" class="header"><a href="#Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Comparing with Shell Sourcing">Comparing with Shell Sourcing</a></h2></div>

<p>
Much like a shell sources a file to set the environment, your Nuke <code>init.py</code>  can “source” extra configuration by either importing a Python module or by modifying paths. The key is that your base <code>init.py</code>  is always executed and can decide what to load next based on environment variables or command-line arguments.
</p>

<div id="Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Comparing with Shell Sourcing-In Summary"><h3 id="In Summary" class="header"><a href="#Custom Config Based on Environment Variables-Comparing with Shell Sourcing-In Summary">In Summary</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Yes, it’s possible to have a “setup” mode versus a vanilla session.

<li>
A common approach is to check an environment variable (or even command-line arguments if needed) in your default <code>init.py</code>..

<li>
Depending on your needs, you can either import additional configuration directly or modify the <code>NUKE_PATH</code> to point to alternative startup scripts.

<li>
Launching from the command line with the relevant environment variables set determines which configuration is loaded.

</ul>
<p>
This gives you the flexibility to have a custom, fully configured Nuke session when needed without affecting your default, vanilla startup.
</p>

<p>
It's really powerful how Nuke's startup scripting can be manipulated to give you that level of control over your environment—just like sourcing a shell config file but for your compositing workflows. If you dive into customizing your init.py  or NUKE_PATH, you can tailor your Nuke sessions to exactly what you need, and then switch back to vanilla effortlessly when you want a clean slate.
</p>

<div id="Repo Setup With Wrapper"><h1 id="Repo Setup With Wrapper" class="header"><a href="#Repo Setup With Wrapper">Repo Setup With Wrapper</a></h1></div>

<p>
You can achieve this by using a wrapper or setup script that temporarily alters Nuke’s environment for that session without changing the user’s permanent configuration. The idea is to let your custom repository (which contains a folder like <code>./nuke_custom</code> with its own <code>init.py</code>, <code>menu.py</code>, and plugins) be used only when you explicitly launch Nuke in the “custom” mode.
</p>

<div id="Repo Setup With Wrapper-Here’s one common approach:"><h2 id="Here’s one common approach:" class="header"><a href="#Repo Setup With Wrapper-Here’s one common approach:">Here’s one common approach:</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Repo Setup With Wrapper-Here’s one common approach:-Organize Your Custom Config"></span><strong id="Organize Your Custom Config">Organize Your Custom Config</strong>: In your repository, have a directory (say, ./nuke_custom) that contains your custom startup files and plugins. The default user config remains in ~/.nuke.

<li>
<span id="Repo Setup With Wrapper-Here’s one common approach:-Write a Shell Wrapper Script"></span><strong id="Write a Shell Wrapper Script">Write a Shell Wrapper Script</strong>: Create a shell script in your repository (for example, setup_nuke_custom.sh) that sets necessary environment variables for the desired session. For example:
<table>
<tr>
<td>
See note on $PWD below.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<pre bash>
#!/bin/bash
# In this wrapper script, we set the environment so that Nuke uses both the vanilla and custom directories.
#
# NUKE_PATH is processed in reverse order—directories later in the list have higher priority.
#
# In this example, we append our custom configuration after the vanilla configuration so that
# the custom startup files will override any conflicting settings.
export NUKE_PATH="$HOME/.nuke:$PWD/nuke_custom"

# Optionally, set a flag the custom scripts can check, e.g.:
export NUKE_CUSTOM_CONFIG=1

# Launch Nuke (adjust the path to your Nuke installation)
/Applications/Nuke15.1v7/Nuke15.1v7.app/Contents/MacOS/Nuke
</pre>

</ul>
<div id="Repo Setup With Wrapper-Here’s one common approach:-In this setup:"><h4 id="In this setup:" class="header"><a href="#Repo Setup With Wrapper-Here’s one common approach:-In this setup:">In this setup:</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
When the script is run, the <code>NUKE_PATH</code> environment variable is temporarily altered—adding your custom configuration directory along with the user’s standard configuration directory.

<li>
Because Nuke loads startup scripts by scanning directories in the NUKE_PATH in reverse order (i.e., directories later in the list override earlier ones), your custom configuration takes precedence over the vanilla one.

<li>
Users who launch Nuke by running this script will get the enhanced environment, while launching Nuke directly (or with a “clean” shell that lacks these modifications) will use only the default <code>~/.nuke</code> settings.

</ul>
<div id="Repo Setup With Wrapper-Here’s one common approach:-Using the Setup Option:"><h3 id="Using the Setup Option:" class="header"><a href="#Repo Setup With Wrapper-Here’s one common approach:-Using the Setup Option:">Using the Setup Option:</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
If a collaborator or user clones your repository and runs the provided setup script, they get a session with your project-specific customizations.

<li>
On the other hand, if they open a new shell without running the script, Nuke simply uses the normal configuration in <code>~/.nuke</code>.

</ul>
<p>
This method allows for a project-specific “switch” for Nuke without permanently altering the user’s environment. If needed, you can enhance this approach by adding conditional logic in your standard <code>~/.nuke/init.py</code> to check for an environment flag (like <code>NUKE_CUSTOM_CONFIG</code>) and load additional modules or alter settings accordingly.
</p>

<div id="Running Commands From An Alias"><h1 id="Running Commands From An Alias" class="header"><a href="#Running Commands From An Alias">Running Commands From An Alias</a></h1></div>

<p>
When you use $PWD in an alias or a script, it expands to the current working directory at the time the alias or script is executed—not the location of the script itself.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you're in directory <code>/Users/username/project</code> and you run your setup script via an alias that uses <code>\(PWD/nuke_custom</code>, it will resolve to <code>/Users/username/project/nuke_custom</code>. However, if you run the alias from a different directory, the value of \)PWD will change accordingly.
</p>

<p>
If your intention is to always reference the directory where the script itself resides (e.g., the repository root), you’ll need a different approach. For example, in a Bash script you can determine the script’s own directory with something like:
</p>

<pre bash>
SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &amp;&amp; pwd )"
export NUKE_PATH="$HOME/.nuke_custom:$SCRIPT_DIR/nuke_custom"
</pre>

<p>
This way, no matter where you call the script from, it will correctly use the script’s directory. But if using <code>$PWD</code> is acceptable for your workflow (i.e., it should always be relative to the current working directory when launching the alias), then it will work as long as you’re aware of that behavior.

<p>
This line is a common Bash idiom used to determine the absolute directory in which the current script resides, regardless of where you run the script from. Here’s how it works:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Running Commands From An Alias-Let's break down the line-Step-by-step.-&quot;\({BASH_SOURCE[0]}&quot;"></span><strong id="&quot;\){BASH_SOURCE[0]}&quot;">"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"</strong>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Running Commands From An Alias-Let's break down the line-Step-by-step.-What it is"></span><strong id="What it is">What it is</strong>: BASH_SOURCE is an array variable provided by Bash. The first element, ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}, holds the path to the script that is currently being executed.

<span id="Running Commands From An Alias-Let's break down the line-Step-by-step.-Result"></span><strong id="Result">Result</strong>: The output of <code>pwd</code> is the absolute path of the script's directory.

<ul>
<li>
<code>${BASH_SOURCE[0]}</code>: Gets the file path of the current script.

<li>
<span id="Running Commands From An Alias-Let's break down the line-In Summary-Assignment"></span><strong id="Assignment">Assignment</strong>: The output is saved to <code>SCRIPT_DIR</code>.

</ul>
<p>
This idiom is widely used when you want your script to refer to files relative to its own location, regardless of the current working directory when the script is executed.

<div id="Setting ONLY Custom Nuke Settings"><h1 id="Setting ONLY Custom Nuke Settings" class="header"><a href="#Setting ONLY Custom Nuke Settings">Setting ONLY Custom Nuke Settings</a></h1></div>

<p>
If you set the <code>NUKE_PATH</code> to ONLY the custom path, Nuke ignore the usual set up until a new shell is opened (or initiated).
</p>

<p>
The NUKE_PATH environment variable tells Nuke where to look for its startup scripts (like init.py  and menu.py), plugins, and other resources. By setting NUKE_PATH to only point to your custom directory (for example, via a wrapper or setup script), Nuke will ignore the user's default configuration in ~/.nuke for that session.
</p>

<div id="Setting ONLY Custom Nuke Settings-Consider this scenario:"><h2 id="Consider this scenario:" class="header"><a href="#Setting ONLY Custom Nuke Settings-Consider this scenario:">Consider this scenario:</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Setting ONLY Custom Nuke Settings-Consider this scenario:-Custom Shell Session"></span><strong id="Custom Shell Session">Custom Shell Session</strong>: Suppose you launch a shell and set:

</ul>
  
<pre bash>
export NUKE_PATH="$HOME/path/to/nuke_custom"
</pre>

<p>
Then, when you run Nuke from that shell, it will only search for startup scripts and plugins in the <code>nuke_custom</code> directory. The usual configurations in <code>~/.nuke</code> will be completely bypassed because they aren’t included in <code>NUKE_PATH</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Setting ONLY Custom Nuke Settings-Consider this scenario:-Normal Shell Session"></span><strong id="Normal Shell Session">Normal Shell Session</strong>: In a new shell session where you haven’t set <code>NUKE_PATH</code>, Nuke will revert to its default behavior—typically looking in <code>~/.nuke</code> for configuration files. This means your regular environment remains untouched by the custom setup.

</ul>
<p>
This approach effectively lets you have two modes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A custom mode triggered by a specific shell (or alias) that sets NUKE_PATH to your custom directory.

<li>
A vanilla mode where Nuke uses the standard <code>~/.nuke</code> configuration.

</ul>
<p>
Just be aware that NUKE_PATH completely overrides the default search path when defined. So if you only include your custom directory, you won't get any files from the default setup unless you explicitly append them like this:
</p>

<pre bash>
export NUKE_PATH="$HOME/path/to/nuke_custom:$HOME/.nuke"
</pre>

<p>
But in the case of replacing regular Nuke settings, you want to isolate the custom environment entirely for that session, and setting NUKE_PATH to just the custom path will do exactly that. Once you open a new shell where NUKE_PATH isn't altered, Nuke will use the usual user configuration.
