<p>
Sometimes, on opening a scene file, half the nodes are missing, and the Nuke file is corrupt.

<ul>
<li>
My scene file got corrupted. It wouldn't render on the farm, and when I reopened the scene after quitting, half the nodes were lost.

</ul>

<p>
Nafisa Baker - took a look (live on a Zoom call!) and fixed it.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Groups:

<ul>
<li>
In the text file:

<ul>
<li>
Nafisa looked for non-closed groups.

<li>
In the corrupt scene file, one of the last nodes on a chain (where previously the stream continued) was a 'painterly_pmnt1' Group node:

<ul>
<li>
Nafisa added the 'end_group' line where it should be.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Upon opening the edited file in Nuke:

<ul>
<li>
In the script editor's window message window:

<ul>
<li>
"can't read "C1e6a4c00": no such variable"

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Nafisa then searched for the variable in the file (text edit):

<ul>
<li>
For example:

</ul>
</ul>
  
<pre>
clone $C9412bd90 {
xpos -2230
ypos 1066
selected false
}
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
This block of the 'clone' node was deleted.

<li>
Nafisa opened the saved file in Nuke again, and found another "can't read..." error for another clone.

<li>
Nafisa deleted this clone block also.

<li>
Opening scene again, and everything was fine, except for a corrupt Painterly_pmnt group node, and some disconnected pipes in the area area of the Group node..

</ul>
