<p>
Find and confirm Python version and architecture of Nuke's own Python interpreter.
</p>

<p>
In my case, this worked:
</p>
<pre sh>
/Applications/Nuke16.0v4/Nuke16.0v4.app/Contents/MacOS/python -c "import sys; print(sys.version); import platform; print(platform.machine())"
</pre>

<p>
My instance returned the following:
</p>
<pre sh>
3.11.7 (remotes/origin/foundry/v3.11.7:88283f3425, Oct  8 2024, 09:50:25) [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)]

<p>
Setting up OpenImageIO (OIIO) for Nuke 16 on an Apple Silicon (M3) Mac requires compiling the Python bindings for the correct architecture and making them available to Nuke's internal Python environment. Using Homebrew is the easiest method for a streamlined build process.

Homebrew's openimageio formula has built-in support for Apple Silicon, which greatly simplifies the installation. 
Install OpenImageIO: Open your terminal and run the following command to install OIIO along with its required dependencies like OpenEXR and OpenColorIO.
</p>

<pre sh>
brew install openimageio

The Python libraries will be in a subdirectory like /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages.

<p>
There are two ways to add the OIIO Python bindings to Nuke's environment.
</p>

<div id="Gemini Response to Installing OpenImageIO for Nuke on MacOS-Before you begin-Step 2: Configure Nuke's Python environment-Option 1: Use PYTHONPATH in a shell script"><h4 id="Option 1: Use PYTHONPATH in a shell script" class="header"><a href="#Gemini Response to Installing OpenImageIO for Nuke on MacOS-Before you begin-Step 2: Configure Nuke's Python environment-Option 1: Use PYTHONPATH in a shell script">Option 1: Use PYTHONPATH in a shell script</a></h4></div>

<p>
This is the most reliable method for launching Nuke with custom libraries.
</p>

<p>
Create a shell script, for example launch_nuke.sh, with the following content:
</p>

<pre sh>
#!/bin/sh

# Path to the OIIO site-packages installed by Homebrew
export OIIO_PYTHON_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages"

# Append the OIIO path to PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="${OIIO_PYTHON_PATH}:${PYTHONPATH}"

# Launch Nuke
/Applications/Nuke16.0v4/Nuke16.0v4.app/Contents/MacOS/Nuke16.0v4 "$@"
</pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Use code with caution.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Make the script executable:
</p>

<pre sh>
chmod +x launch_nuke.sh
</pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Use code with caution.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
This will automatically configure the path every time Nuke starts, without a custom launcher. 
Navigate to your Nuke user directory in the terminal:
</p>

<pre sh>
cd ~/.nuke
</pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Use code with caution.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Open the init.py file in a text editor. If it doesn't exist, create it.
</p>

<pre sh>
open -a "TextEdit" init.py
</pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Use code with caution.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Add the following Python code to the file, making sure the path is correct for your Homebrew installation:
</p>

<pre python>
import sys

# Add the Homebrew Python site-packages directory to Nuke's Python path
sys.path.append("/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages")
</pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Use code with caution.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Launch Nuke using one of the methods above.
</p>

<p>
In the Script Editor, run this code to verify the installation.
</p>

<pre python>
import OpenImageIO as oiio
print("OpenImageIO version:", oiio.VERSION)

# Verify OpenImageIO functionality by reading image info
# (Replace 'path/to/image.exr' with a valid image file)
image_path = "/path/to/your/test_image.exr"
if oiio.ImageInput.open(image_path):
    print(f"Successfully opened {image_path} with OpenImageIO.")
else:
    print(f"Failed to open image: {oiio.geterror()}")
</pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Use code with caution.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
If the script prints the OIIO version number and the test is successful, your installation is working correctly.
