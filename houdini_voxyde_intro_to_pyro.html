Houdini's Pyro is a very impressive tool for fire and smoke simulations.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial hopes to provide the foundation for relatively simple setups for the most impressive results.
</p>

<table>

To see any shading or features on the volume/smoke simulation in the viewport, you'll need a Direct/Sun light in the scene. Otherwise (at least on a MacOS system) the volume/smoke is flat white.

<p>
This section shows our first Pyro setup, and will aim to introduce the concepts of:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>Sources</code> and <code>Shaping</code> as the two considerations for Pyro setups,

<li>
and of <code>Microsolvers</code> for dynamics control. 

</ol>
<div id="Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-Demo - Pyrosolver"><h3 id="Demo - Pyrosolver" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-Demo - Pyrosolver">Demo - Pyrosolver</a></h3></div>


<ul>
<li>
Inside a <code>Geometry</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Pyrosolver</code> node (this contains all the dynamics logic):

<ul>
<li>
Notice all the tabs:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Setup</code>

<li>
<code>Bounds</code>

<li>
<code>Collision</code>

<li>
<code>Sourcing</code> (We'll use this shortly!)

<li>
<code>Fields</code> (We'll touch on this too)

<li>
<code>Shape</code> (Another one we'll use out of the gate)

<li>
<code>Look</code>

<li>
<code>Advanced</code>

<li>
<code>Output</code>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-Sources tab:"><h3 id="Sources tab:" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-Sources tab:">Sources tab:</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
This is the most important tab - without sources, we can't have anything happen!

<li>
The smoke and fire cannot be simulated in or from nothing:

<ul>
<li>
It must have a <code>Volume</code> to exist within.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Above the <code>Pyrosolver</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>Sphere (Polygon)</code>:

<ul>
<li>
And switch the <code>Primitive Type</code> to <code>Polygon</code>

<li>
<code>Frequency</code> to 10

</ul>
<li>
<code>Uniform Scale</code> to 3

</ul>
<p>
<br>
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Scale is very important with fire and smoke simulations.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
After the Sphere, we need to create a volume as a source for the solver:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Drop a <code>VDB from Polygons</code> nodes:

<ul>
<li>
We don't want a Signed Distance Field here, we want a full volume:

<ul>
<li>
Turn OFF the <code>Distance VDB</code>

<li>
Turn ON the <code>Fog VDB</code> option:

<ul>
<li>
The default <code>density</code> attribute is good for us moving forward.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Add a <code>Null</code> to keep things organized:

<ul>
<li>
Rename to <code>SOURCE</code>

</ul>
<li>
Plug the <code>SOURCE</code> null into the <code>Pyrosolver</code> (input 1)

</ul>
<p>
<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
MacOS: To see any shaping on the voxels of the volume in the Viewport on MacOS, we'll need to add a 'Distant' light. For whatever reason, this will trigger some shaping on the voxels. It's not a full effect as seen in the tutorial (we lack AO for example), but at least it's better than the flat white with no light added. I added two 'Distant' lights (one below as a fill).
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
If you press 'play' on the timeline at this stage, nothing really looks like smoke. Actually the smoke is gaining density as a density of '1' is added each frame, but there is no motion, so it just builds up in place.
</p>

<div id="Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-Shape tab"><h3 id="Shape tab" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-Shape tab">Shape tab</a></h3></div>

<p>
This is where we can initiate some forces.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-Shape tab-NOTE"></span><strong id="NOTE">NOTE</strong>: <em>The 'Buoyancy' check 'on' by default, but that's driven by a 'temperature' attribute (which we don't have).</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Switch off the <code>Buoyancy</code> checkbox.

<li>
Turn 'On' <code>Turbulence</code> to get our first motion field:

<ul>
<li>
Toggle the little widget to open the dialog for turbulence.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Again, if we 'play' the timeline, not much happens. This is because the simulation is wired to look for 'temperature' as an attribute (which we don't have).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Set <code>Threshold Field</code> from 'temperature' to <code>density</code> (which is an attribute we already have).

</ul>
<p>
Now we have our first dynamics on the smoke!
</p>


<p>
The smoke is disappearing too fast:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In the <code>Fields</code> tab:

<ul>
<li>
Decrease the <code>Dissapation</code> value (maybe 0.2)

<li>
Playback shows the smoke having more time to develop.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Try adjusting the dials on the Turbulence settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Shape</code> tab:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Turbulence</code> (like amplitude)

<li>
<code>Swirl Size</code> (scale of noise)

<li>
<code>Roughness</code> (detail)

<li>
<code>Pulse Length</code> (animation rate)

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
We have the <code>Shape</code> tab with some pre-made forces or shaping fields. While there are many fields to implement and adjust, we are not limited to these.
</p>

<p>
If we double-click the <code>pyrosolver</code> node, we are dropped into a <code>Dynamics</code> area, where there are outputs to which we can add our own fields using the armory of DOP nodes - <code>microsolvers</code>.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-Shaping-NOTE"></span><strong id="NOTE">NOTE</strong>: <em>Double clicking drops you inside the inner DOP Network, bypassing the 'dopnet' container. It assumes that we want to edit this area, and not the level above. The exposed and 'promoted' fields are already on the 'pyrosolver' parameters, so we probably don't need to edit the intermediate area.</em>

<div id="Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-First Microsolver"><h3 id="First Microsolver" class="header"><a href="#Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-First Microsolver">First Microsolver</a></h3></div>

<p>
As an illustration:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Inside the Dynamics DOP Net (double-click on <code>pyrosolver</code>), drop a <code>Gas Turbulence</code> node:

<ul>
<li>
Connect into the <code>force_output</code> node that's already there.

<li>
<code>u</code> key to move back up to the SOP level

<li>
Turn 'off' <code>Turbulence</code> on the <code>Shape</code> tab.

<li>
Pressing play on the timeline, and we'll see turbulence even though there's nothing activated on the <code>Shape</code> tab.

<li>
We are driving the motion form our <code>microsolver</code> (the <code>Gas Turbulence</code> force output).

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<span id="Voxyde - Intro to Pyro-Basic Setup-First Microsolver-<em>Conclusion</em>"></span><strong id="<em>Conclusion</em>"><em>Conclusion</em></strong>: The forces on the <code>Shape</code> tab are actually <code>Microsolvers</code>, and we've already seen how we can add our own.
</p>

<p>
Tabbing inside the inner <code>FORCES</code> DOP net will reveal a sub-tab section called <code>Microsolvers</code> with many nodes with the prefix <code>Gas</code> to choose from.

<p>
To proceed with the demo:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Remove (delete) the <code>Gas Turbulence</code> microsolver from the DOP net within the <code>pyrosolver</code>.

<li>
In the <code>Shape</code> tab on the <code>pyrosolver</code> deactivate all the microsolver options.

</ul>
<p>
Jump onto the <code>Sourcing</code> tab:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Notice all the pre-linked sources in the panel, but at the moment we only have <code>denisty</code> in our setup.

<li>
You can click on the mini-x icon next to each <code>Source</code> sub section to delete them:

<ul>
<li>
Delete them all but our <code>denisity</code> source (which we have as an attribute)

</ul>
<li>
Look at the fields on the Source panel:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Operation</code> has <code>Add</code> by default (adds source each frame), and <code>Scalar</code> for densities (or <code>Vector</code> for velocities)

<li>
<code>Source Volume</code> is <code>density</code> grabbed from our <code>SOURCE</code> which is piped into the solver. (Can be named anything.)

<li>
<code>Source Scale</code> is a multiplier. Setting to 0.1 will only use 10% of the source at a time in the case of <code>Add</code>

<li>
<code>Target Field</code> is the built-in or default name for the attribute used to drive our smoke. (Has to be <code>density</code>.)

<li>
Using the same name for two entities might be confusing at this stage, so understand that we can call the source anything:

<ul>
<li>
Go to the <code>VDB from Polygons</code> node, and change the <code>Fog VDB</code> attribute to <code>source</code>

<li>
Back on the <code>pyrosolver</code> panel, we'll have to change the <code>Source Volume</code> to <code>source</code> to pick that up.

<li>
You'll notice that while this renaming goes on, the Viewport loses the volume.

<li>
Remember: <code>density</code> in the <code>Target Field</code> HAS to be <code>density</code>; it's the internal name for the essential attribute. But we can name our source volume anything we want.

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Now return the <code>SOURCE</code> name back to <code>density</code> from <code>source</code>.

<li>
Change the <code>Source Volume</code> back to <code>density</code> also.

</ul>

<p>
Pyro in Houdini is a powerful dynamics solver specifically designed for creating realistic fire and smoke simulations. It allows for a high degree of control and complexity, enabling artists to generate a wide range of effects, from small-scale phenomena like candle flames to large explosions.
</p>

<div id="Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini - Intro to Pyro-Houdini Pyro FAQ-2. What are sources in Pyro, and why are they important?"><h4 id="2.

What are sources in Pyro, and why are they important?">2. What are sources in Pyro, and why are they important?</a></h4></div>
<p>
Sources in Pyro are volumes that define the initial state and behavior of the simulation. They provide information about density (smoke), temperature (heat), velocity (movement), and other properties. Without sources, the Pyro solver has no foundation to build the simulation upon. They are crucial for dictating the overall look and feel of the effect.

How do microsolvers shape Pyro simulations?</a></h4></div>
<p>
Microsolvers are specialized nodes that introduce forces and dynamics within the Pyro solver. They modify and influence the behavior of the sources, adding turbulence, wind, buoyancy, and other effects. Microsolvers allow you to fine-tune the simulation and create intricate details like swirling smoke or billowing flames.
</p>

<div id="Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini - Intro to Pyro-Houdini Pyro FAQ-4. How do velocity fields influence Pyro simulations, and why are they often preferable to microsolvers?"><h4 id="4.

How do velocity fields influence Pyro simulations, and why are they often preferable to microsolvers?">4. How do velocity fields influence Pyro simulations, and why are they often preferable to microsolvers?</a></h4></div>
<p>
Velocity fields are volumes that directly control the movement of the smoke or fire. You can create them using various techniques, like curl noise, to achieve specific directional flow. Using velocity fields is often advantageous over solely relying on microsolvers because it allows for more direct control over the simulation's motion. It's often easier to guide the smoke along a path or wrap it around geometry using velocity fields.

<div id="Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini - Intro to Pyro-Houdini Pyro FAQ-5. What are the different sourcing operations available in Pyro, and how do they affect the simulation?"><h4 id="5. What are the different sourcing operations available in Pyro, and how do they affect the simulation?" class="header"><a href="#Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini - Intro to Pyro-Houdini Pyro FAQ-5. What are the different sourcing operations available in Pyro, and how do they affect the simulation?">5. What are the different sourcing operations available in Pyro, and how do they affect the simulation?</a></h4></div>
<p>
Pyro offers different sourcing operations like "add", "maximum", and "pull". These operations determine how the source volumes are incorporated into the simulation. "Add" continuously adds the source values each frame, "maximum" clamps the values to prevent excessive accumulation, and "pull" blends the values over time for smoother results. The choice of operation depends on the desired effect.

What is the purpose of the "flame" field in Pyro, and how does it interact with other fields like density and temperature?</a></h4></div>
<p>
The "flame" field represents the areas within the simulation where combustion is occurring. It can influence other fields like density and temperature. For example, you can use the "flame" field to drive continuous expansion by adding divergence or to emit more density or temperature where the flame is present. This creates a more dynamic and realistic fire effect.

How can I create collisions in Pyro simulations?">7. How can I create collisions in Pyro simulations?</a></h4></div>
<p>
You can create collisions in Pyro simulations by defining collision geometry or, preferably, by using SDF (Signed Distance Field) volumes. These volumes store the distance to the surface of an object, allowing for accurate collision detection. If the collision geometry is animated, you can transfer its velocity to the smoke using velocity volumes, resulting in more realistic interaction between the smoke and the object.

<p>
Start with lower resolution: Use a higher voxel size during initial tests to keep simulations fast and then gradually decrease the voxel size for the final output.
Optimize sources: Ensure your source volumes are efficient and not overly complex.
Use velocity fields: Leverage velocity fields for guiding smoke motion instead of relying solely on microsolvers.
Control microsolver influence: Use the control field option in microsolvers to limit their effect based on specific conditions like speed or density.
Use appropriate sourcing operations: Choose the right operation for each source volume to achieve the desired behavior.
Consider SDF collisions: Utilize SDF volumes for collision detection as they are more efficient than geometry-based collisions.
Enable GPU acceleration: If available, use OpenCL mode for faster simulations on the graphics card.
Export only necessary fields: Disable the export of unnecessary fields in the output tab to reduce file size and improve performance.

<ul>
<li>
Pyro Basics:

<ul>
<li>
Pyro is Houdini's core tool for fire and smoke.

<li>
It requires source volumes (density, temperature, etc.) to function.

<li>
Shaping is done through microsolvers and manipulating Target Fields.

<li>
<em>"Pyro solver by default doesn't know how to make fire or smoke out of nothing so we have to base it on some existing volume."</em>

</ul>
<li>
Sourcing:

<ul>
<li>
Source volumes provide the initial data for the simulation.

<li>
Target Fields within Pyro link to specific input names (e.g., density, temperature).

<li>
Noise and variation in sources are crucial for interesting results.

<li>
<em>"The Target Field name has to be one of these built-in ones and again let's just focus on the density for now."</em>

</ul>
<li>
Velocity Fields:

<ul>
<li>
Velocity fields can directly control smoke movement, often reducing the need for excessive microsolvers.

<li>
Creating efficient velocity fields (using appropriate voxel size) is vital for performance.

<li>
<em>"When you want to achieve a specific motion like the smoke going along a curve or wrapping around geometry a lot of times it's easier to just directly tell the smoke how we want it to move with a velocity field."</em>

</ul>
<li>
Operations in Sourcing:

<ul>
<li>
"Add" continuously adds values, causing accumulation (useful for density, not always for velocity).

<li>
"Maximum" clamps values, limiting accumulation (good for consistent speed or temperature).

<li>
"Pull" blends values over time, providing smooth acceleration/deceleration.

<li>
<em>"With this add operation we are going to continuously add on top of what we have already which is fine for density [...] but when it comes to Velocity this add operation accumulates speed over time."</em>

</ul>
<li>
Temperature and Buoyancy:

<ul>
<li>
Temperature drives the rising motion of smoke.

<li>
Buoyancy microsolver controls how temperature affects the upward movement.

<li>
Separate temperature sources with varied noise patterns create more realistic smoke behavior.

<li>
<em>"Smoke Rises when there's heat and this is what the temperature will do for us but in order for this to work we need buoyancy turned on in the shape tab."</em>

</ul>
<li>
Divergence:

<ul>
<li>
Divergence controls expansion or contraction of smoke.

<li>
High, short bursts of divergence are typical for explosions.

<li>
SDF volumes are effective for creating suction effects with divergence.

<li>
<em>"This is what Divergence will do for us it will expand the smoke and we can play around with the operations here and use maximum pull or any of the other ones but typically for Divergence we want to add this in."</em>

</ul>
<li>
Flame Field:

<ul>
<li>
Flame is not just for visuals; it can influence density, temperature, and divergence over time.

<li>
Flame expansion adds divergence based on the flame field's intensity.

<li>
Flame can emit density and temperature, driving continuous effects.

<li>
"With flame we can add more Divergence more temperature and more density throughout the entire duration of the simulation so not just in the beginning where we are sourcing our volumes."

</ul>
<li>
Key Microsolvers:

<ul>
<li>
Disturbance: Adds high-frequency noise for breakup and detail.

<li>
Turbulence: Creates larger swirls and motion in the simulation.

<li>
Shredding: Similar to disturbance but preserves overall speed.

<li>
Viscosity: Smooths and blurs features over time.

<li>
"Disturbance is really important in a lot of Pyosin [...] it's like a very high frequency noise that gives us a lot of breakup that later forms into more interesting features and shapes."

</ul>
<li>
Collisions:

<ul>
<li>
SDF + Volume Velocity: The recommended collision method, offering flexibility and control.

<li>
Importance of SDF Volume Resolution: Enough exterior and interior band voxels are essential for accurate collisions.

<li>
Velocity Transfer: Capturing and transferring velocity from moving collision objects adds realism and detail.

<li>
"Instead of this type this Collision geometry type I will highly recommend that you use SDF plus volume velocity instead."

</ul>
<li>
Optimization and Workflow:

<ul>
<li>
Start with lower resolution (voxel size) for testing and adjustments.

<li>
Increase resolution for final simulations and caching.

<li>
Utilize time scale and max substeps for faster or more accurate simulations.

<li>
Employ sparse simulation type for dynamic expansion, open CL for speed within bounds.

<li>
"The general workflow is that I usually set a higher voxel size when I'm doing tests and while I'm adjusting the sourcing and micros solvers and all the other settings I want the simulations to run as fast as possible."

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Overall, this briefing document summarizes the fundamental concepts and techniques presented in the "Intro To Houdini Pyro" tutorial. It highlights the importance of sourcing, shaping, and understanding the interplay between various Target Fields and microsolvers to create compelling smoke and fire simulations in Houdini.

<div id="Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini Pyro Study Guide-Answer Key"><h3 id="Answer Key" class="header"><a href="#Google's NotebookLM Study Guide-Houdini Pyro Study Guide-Answer Key">Answer Key</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
Sourcing is vital because Pyro cannot create fire or smoke from nothing. Without sources, the Pyro solver would lack the necessary input volumes to generate a simulation, resulting in an error.

<li>
Density in Pyro refers to the concentration of smoke within a volume. Higher density values correspond to thicker, more opaque smoke, while lower values represent thinner, more transparent smoke.

<li>
A source volume is an external volume (like a VDB) containing data like density or velocity. The target field is a specific internal field within the Pyro solver that receives and interprets this data to drive the simulation (e.g., density source volume goes into the density target field).

<li>
The "Add" operation cumulatively adds density or velocity values each frame. For density, this results in increasingly thick smoke. For velocity, it leads to accelerating speed over time.

<li>
Velocity fields directly control the motion of smoke, providing a foundation for shaping the simulation. Microsolvers can then be added on top to introduce details and variations while maintaining the overall movement guided by the velocity field.

<li>
Voxel size determines the resolution of the velocity field. Smaller voxel size yields more detailed but computationally expensive simulations. Larger voxel sizes lead to faster simulations but potentially smoother results.

<li>
Unlike "Add," which accumulates speed, "Maximum" adds velocity while clamping the maximum speed based on the length of the sampled velocity vectors. This prevents runaway acceleration but might require adjustments to velocity field strength.

<li>
Buoyancy simulates the rising of hot smoke and falling of cold smoke. Key parameters include the buoyancy scale (overall strength), ambient and reference temperatures, and gravity direction and acceleration.

<li>
The flame field represents the areas of combustion within the simulation. It influences divergence (expansion), density (smoke production), and temperature (heat) to create a dynamic and evolving fire effect.

<li>
"Emit from Flame" adds density or temperature continuously where flame values exist, sustaining smoke production and heat even without initial sources. Using "Add" can lead to excessive accumulation, so "Maximum" or "Pull" are often preferred for smoother results.
