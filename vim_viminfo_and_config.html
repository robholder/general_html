The viminfo file is a powerful feature in Vim that helps retain certain data between sessions. While it's not actively configured in your Vimrc, Vim likely defaults to using ~/.vim/viminfo in your setup. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of how viminfo works and how you can utilize it:
</p>

<div id="My Settings"><h1 id="My Settings" class="header"><a href="#My Settings">My Settings</a></h1></div>

<p>
This is what I'm using, but all this is explored on this page.
</p>

<p>
The settings can be a bit hit or miss. I couldn't get the 'n' flag to work to set the filepath, and had to use 'set viminfofile' explicitly in the end.

<p>
The <code>viminfo</code> file is used by Vim to persist data across sessions. This includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Command-line history:

<ul>
<li>
Stores commands typed in command mode (<code>:</code>).

</ul>
<li>
Search history:

<ul>
<li>
Retains patterns searched using <code>/</code> or <code>?</code>.

</ul>
<li>
Registers:

<ul>
<li>
Keeps the contents of certain registers (e.g., unnamed or named registers).

<li>
You have to specify a <code>"&lt;number&gt;</code> flag to specify how many lines are saved else they are not saved at all.

</ul>
<li>
Marks:

<ul>
<li>
Saves file marks, allowing you to return to a previous cursor position in files.

</ul>
<li>
Last edited files:

<ul>
<li>
Remembers recently opened files for quick access.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
The file location defaults to <code>~/.viminfo</code> or <code>~/.vim/viminfo</code> , but you can specify or customize it.
</p>

<p>
In the viminfo string the key flag for saving normally named registers is the double‑quote flag (for example, "50), which tells Vim to save up to 50 lines per register. The r flag is separate and is used to include additional registers (typically, some read‑only or special registers) in the viminfo file. In most typical setups, if you include "50 in your viminfo but don’t include r, Vim will still save your regular (named) registers with a limit of 50 lines each.
</p>

<p>
So, omitting r does not prevent registers from being saved; it simply means that only the registers covered by the "50 setting are saved. If you need Vim to preserve extra registers (or specific types of registers that aren’t saved by default), then you’d add r as well. Otherwise, "50 alone is sufficient for standard register saving.
</p>

Here’s a typical setup for persistent data:
</p>

<pre vim>
set viminfo='100,&lt;50,s10,h,r
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Remembers marks for the last 100 files.

<li>
Saves the last 50 commands.

<li>
Retains the last 10 search patterns.

<li>
Does not save the <code>hlsearch</code> setting.

<li>
Keeps register contents persistent.

<p>
It looks like my viminfo settings are being overwritten by "vim-polygot" (plugin). Does this sound correct? Even though I have the viminfo settings in my vimrc, running ":verbose set viminfo?" gives me: viminfo=!,'100,&lt;100,s50,h,r Last set from ~/.vim/plugged/vim-polyglot/plugin/polyglot.vim line 85 a
</p>

<div id="Issues-My Question-Copilot Answer"><h4 id="Copilot Answer" class="header"><a href="#Issues-My Question-Copilot Answer">Copilot Answer</a></h4></div>

<p>
Yes, that sounds correct. The output you’re seeing from :verbose set viminfo? indicates that your viminfo settings were last set in the vim-polyglot plugin (specifically at line 85 in its file). This means that—even though you have your preferred settings in your vimrc—vim-polyglot is overwriting them later in the startup process.

<p>
Move Your viminfo Setting: Place your desired viminfo setting at the end of your vimrc (or in a file that’s sourced after vim-polyglot loads). For example, add:
</p>

<pre vim>
set viminfo='100,&lt;100,s50,h,r
</pre>

<p>
at the very end of your vimrc. This will override the settings imposed by vim-polyglot.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Issues-My Question-Why This Happens-How to Fix It-Check Plugin Options"></span><strong id="Check Plugin Options">Check Plugin Options</strong>: Review the documentation for vim-polyglot to see if it offers a variable or configuration option to disable or adjust its viminfo settings.

<p>
After moving your viminfo setting, you can verify the change by restarting Vim and then running:
</p>

<pre vim>
:verbose set viminfo?

<p>
The output should now indicate that the last setting comes from your vimrc (or the file you've put it in) rather than from vim-polyglot.

Using <code>set viminfo+=...</code> The <code>+=</code> operator tells Vim to append this portion to the current value of the <code>'viminfo'</code> option rather than replacing it entirely.

<li>
<code>n./.vim-viminfo/viminfo</code>

<ul>
<li>
The <code>n</code> flag in the <code>'viminfo'</code> option specifies the name of the file where Vim should store its session information.

<li>
The <code>.</code> immediately following the <code>n</code> means the file is specified as a relative path (relative to the current working directory) rather than an absolute one.

<li>
In other words, Vim is being told: "For this project (local context), use <code>./.vim-viminfo/viminfo</code> as the viminfo file."

</ul>
<li>
<code>n~/.vim/viminfo</code>

<ul>
<li>
Similarly, this tells Vim to use <code>~/.vim/viminfo</code> as the viminfo file, which is a global (absolute) path located in your home directory’s <code>.vim</code> folder.

<li>
Does it ensure there is a <code>~/.vim directory</code>? <code>Yes</code>. The initial check creates <code>~/.vim</code> if it isn’t present.

<li>
Is it checking to see if a 'local' directory and file exists, matching <code>.vim-viminfo/viminfo</code>? Not exactly. It appends a setting that tells Vim to use a relative path (<code>./.vim-viminfo/viminfo</code>) for viminfo. It does not, however, perform a check on whether that specific directory or file exists.

<li>
If the file above doesn’t exist, is it using <code>~/.vim/viminfo</code> instead? Not conditionally. Both settings are appended unconditionally as long as <code>~/.vim</code> exists. In practice, because the global setting is appended last, it will override the relative setting—so Vim will end up using <code>~/.vim/viminfo</code> regardless.

</ul>

I hope this clears up what each part of the snippet is doing and how Vim ends up choosing the viminfo file. Let me know if you need further clarification or additional details!

<p>
In what circumstances would this setup make the viminfo path use the local one? It seems flawed in its present form. I can't think of a situation where the local path would be used. If this is so, is there a better way to set this up so it would use the local path <em>if present</em> and fallback to the global path if not. My guess is to reverse the options (and put the global path first).

<p>
Your intuition is correct—a setting like this:
</p>

<pre vim>
set viminfo+=n./.vim-viminfo/viminfo
set viminfo+=n~/.vim/viminfo
</pre>

<p>
...will always end up using the global path because the last <code>"n"</code> flag added (the global one) overrides any earlier ones.
</p>

<p>
In Vim, when you append multiple <code>"n"</code> flags to <code>'viminfo'</code>, the flag that’s processed last is the one that takes effect. So in your current configuration, even if you want to use a project‐specific (local) viminfo file, the global path wins out.
</p>

<div id="Copilot Discussion On Vimrc Files-Copilot Answer-When Would the Local Path Be Used?"><h4 id="When Would the Local Path Be Used?" class="header"><a href="#Copilot Discussion On Vimrc Files-Copilot Answer-When Would the Local Path Be Used?">When Would the Local Path Be Used?</a></h4></div>

<p>
In the present form, there isn’t a circumstance where the local path will be taken over the global one. The way it’s written, the global setting is always appended last and therefore always wins.
</p>

<div id="Copilot Discussion On Vimrc Files-Copilot Answer-A Better, Conditional Setup"><h4 id="A Better, Conditional Setup" class="header"><a href="#Copilot Discussion On Vimrc Files-Copilot Answer-A Better, Conditional Setup">A Better, Conditional Setup</a></h4></div>

<p>
If you want Vim to use a local viminfo file when available and fall back to a global file otherwise, you’ll need to decide this conditionally. For example, you might want to check if a certain directory or file exists in the current project and set <code>'viminfo'</code> accordingly.
</p>

<p>
One approach is to completely decide which <code>"n"</code> flag to use rather than appending both. For example:
</p>

<pre vim>
" Ensure the ~/.vim directory exists
if !isdirectory($HOME . '/.vim')
    silent! execute '!mkdir -p ~/.vim'
endif

" Use project-specific viminfo file, if the local directory exists.
if isdirectory('./.vim-viminfo')
    " Set viminfo with the local path.
    set viminfo='100,&lt;100,s50,h,r,n./.vim-viminfo/viminfo
else
    " Fallback to the global viminfo file.
    set viminfo='100,&lt;100,s50,h,r,n~/.vim/viminfo
endif
</pre>

<p>
In this setup, you completely assign the <code>'viminfo'</code> option based on whether the relative directory exists. That way, if you have a <code>.vim-viminfo</code> directory in your project, Vim will store session data there; otherwise it uses the global file.
</p>

<p>
If you prefer to use the <code>+=</code> approach (for example, if you want to maintain additional flags already set elsewhere), you could first set the global value and then conditionally override it. For instance:
</p>

<pre vim>
" First, set up a default (global) viminfo file:
set viminfo='100,&lt;100,s50,h,r,n~/.vim/viminfo

" Then, if a project-specific directory exists, remove the global "n" flag and add the local one.
if isdirectory('./.vim-viminfo')
    " Remove the global n flag (if possible) then add the local one.
    " (Vim doesn’t provide an easy way to remove a specific flag,
    " so it might be simpler to reassign the whole option as above.)
    set viminfo+='100,&lt;100,s50,h,r,n./.vim-viminfo/viminfo
endif
</pre>

<p>
The first (complete reassignment) method is easier to manage because it decides the entire value rather than trying to patch an existing one with +=.
