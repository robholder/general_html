<p>
Vim has 8 different means to execute commands across multiple files.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>:argdo</code> --&gt; arg list files

<li>
<code>:bufdo</code> --&gt; buffers

<li>
<code>:windo</code> --&gt; windows in the current tab

<li>
<code>:tabdo</code> --&gt; tabs

<li>
<code>:cdo</code> --&gt; items in the quickfix list

<li>
<code>:cfdo</code> --&gt; files in the quickfix list

<li>
<code>:ldo</code> --&gt; items in the location list

<li>
<code>:lfdo</code> --&gt; files in the location list

</ul>
<div id="Multi-File Operations-Creating Lists"><h4 id="Creating Lists" class="header"><a href="#Multi-File Operations-Creating Lists">Creating Lists</a></h4></div>

<p>
These commands require you to make a list in their respective categories (argument list, buffer list, window list, tab list, quickfix list, and location
list) before you can run the command.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>argdo</code>: To create an argument list, run <code>:args file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt</code>

<li>
<code>bufdo</code>: To create a buffer list, just open more files (like <code>:e file1.txt</code>)

<li>
<code>windo</code>: To create a window list, create more split windows (like <code>:vsplit file1.txt</code>)

<li>
<code>tabdo:</code> To create a tab list, create more tabs (like :<code>tabnew tab1</code>)

<li>
<code>cdo</code> &amp; <code>cfdo</code>: To create a quickfix list, use a command that uses quickfix (like <code>:vimgrep /searchkeyword/ *.txt</code>)

<li>
<code>ldo</code> and <code>lfdo</code>: To create a location list, use a command that uses location list (like :<code>lvimgrep /searchkeyword/ *.txt</code>)

</ul>
<p>
On this page, <code>:argdo</code> will be used predominantly, but overall the flow is the same for all of them.
</p>

<div id="On Quickfix Lists and Location Lists"><h1 id="On Quickfix Lists and Location Lists" class="header"><a href="#On Quickfix Lists and Location Lists">On Quickfix Lists and Location Lists</a></h1></div>

<p>
You can gather the same 'locations' across the same available file material, but it's what happens to that list (restricted to a window or not) that makes the difference to Quickfix lists and Location Lists.
</p>

<div id="On Quickfix Lists and Location Lists-This is the distinction."><h4 id="This is the distinction." class="header"><a href="#On Quickfix Lists and Location Lists-This is the distinction.">This is the distinction.</a></h4></div>

<p>
Both quickfix lists and location lists can gather similar "locations" across the same material, such as search matches or error reports from multiple files. The key difference lies in how the list is scoped and managed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Quickfix Lists: These are global to the entire Vim session. You can access and navigate them from any window or buffer. They're ideal for tasks spanning multiple files, like compiling code or running a search over a directory.

<li>
Location Lists: These are local to a specific window. Even if the list includes references to multiple files, the list itself is tied to the window where it was created. This makes location lists better suited for localized or file-specific tasks, while still allowing file-spanning entries.

</ul>
<p>
In other words, it's less about the data gathered and more about the scope of the list's availability and control
</p>

<p>
Here's a quick example to illustrate when you'd favor one over the other:

<ul>
<li>
Scenario: You're working on a codebase with multiple files, and you want to search for all instances of <code>T0DO</code> comments across the entire project to clean them up.

<ul>
<li>
You'd use a quickfix list because:

<li>
The task involves multiple files across the project, not just the one you're currently editing.

<li>
With a quickfix list, you can jump between files using :cnext and :cprev, and the quickfix list remains accessible no matter which window or file you're in.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Workflow:
</p>

<pre vim>
:grep T0DO **/*.py
:copen
</pre>

<p>
This creates a quickfix list with all T0DO entries across .py files, letting you navigate and clean them up project-wide.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Scenario: You're focused on fixing linting issues in just one file, and your linter outputs warnings like "Unused variable" or "Trailing whitespace."

<ul>
<li>
You'd use a location list because:

<li>
It's scoped to the window displaying the file you're working on, so it keeps your focus on the file in question.

<li>
You might have multiple windows open for different tasks, and each window can have its own location list specific to that task.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Workflow:
</p>

<pre vim>
:lopen
</pre>

<p>
After your linter outputs errors to the location list, you can navigate them (<code>:lnext</code>, <code>:lprev</code>) and resolve the issues in just that file or window.

<p>
The difference between <code>:cdo</code> and <code>:cfdo</code> commands, and how they interact with quickfix lists and files:
</p>

<p>
Let’s break them down and highlight the distinctions.
</p>

<div id=":cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:cdo &amp; :cfdo-:cdo - Acts on Quickfix List Entries"><h4 id=":cdo - Acts on Quickfix List Entries" class="header"><a href="#:cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:cdo &amp; :cfdo-:cdo - Acts on Quickfix List Entries">:cdo - Acts on Quickfix List Entries</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
What It Does:

<ul>
<li>
The <code>:cdo</code> command applies a given action (like search, substitute, or any Ex command) to each entry in the quickfix list.

<li>
The action is carried out at the specific locations stored in the quickfix list, which may span across multiple files and line numbers.

</ul>
<li>
Use Case:

<ul>
<li>
Best for working on individual matches or specific locations across files.

</ul>
<li>
Example: Let’s say you searched for T0DO across your project:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:grep T0DO **/*.py
:cdo s/T0DO/DONE/g | update
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
This substitutes <code>T0DO</code> with <code>DONE</code> at each location in the quickfix list.

</ul>
<p>
update saves the changes after substitution.
</p>

<div id=":cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:cdo &amp; :cfdo-:cfdo - Acts on Files Referenced in Quickfix List"><h4 id=":cfdo - Acts on Files Referenced in Quickfix List" class="header"><a href="#:cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:cdo &amp; :cfdo-:cfdo - Acts on Files Referenced in Quickfix List">:cfdo - Acts on Files Referenced in Quickfix List</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
What It Does:

<ul>
<li>
The <code>:cfdo</code> command applies the given action to every file referenced in the quickfix list, regardless of the specific locations within those files.

<li>
It loops through the files, executing the command on each one in its entirety.

</ul>
<li>
Use Case:

<ul>
<li>
Best for performing file-wide actions or tasks unrelated to specific locations (like formatting or batch updates across files).

</ul>
<li>
Example: Suppose you want to format all files that have entries in the quickfix list:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:cfdo normal gg=G | update
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
This formats (<code>gg=G</code>) the entire file for each file in the quickfix list.

<li>
<code>update</code> saves the changes to all files after formatting.

<ul>
<li>
Use <code>:cdo</code>:

<ul>
<li>
When you need precision—making edits at specific locations like search results, errors, or compiler warnings.

<li>
Example: Replacing text at each location across multiple files.

</ul>
<li>
Use <code>:cfdo</code>:

<ul>
<li>
When you need to perform a file-wide operation across all affected files, such as applying formatting, cleaning up blank lines, or saving all files.

<li>
Example: Running normal <code>gg=G</code> on every file found in the quickfix list.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
If you’ve got tasks that need both, you could even use them in combination—working at individual locations first with <code>:cdo</code>, then handling broader file-wide cleanup with <code>:cfdo</code>.
</p>


<div id=":cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:ldo and lfdo"><h2 id=":ldo and lfdo" class="header"><a href="#:cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:ldo and lfdo">:ldo and lfdo</a></h2></div>

<p>
<code>:ldo</code> and <code>:lfdo</code> are counterparts to <code>:cdo</code> and <code>:cfdo</code>, but they operate on the location list instead of the quickfix list. Here's a breakdown of what they do and when to use them:
</p>

<div id=":cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:ldo and lfdo-:ldo - Acts on Location List Entries"><h4 id=":ldo - Acts on Location List Entries" class="header"><a href="#:cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:ldo and lfdo-:ldo - Acts on Location List Entries">:ldo - Acts on Location List Entries</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
What It Does:

<ul>
<li>
Similar to <code>:cdo</code>, the <code>:ldo</code> command applies a given action (like search, replace, or any Ex command) to each entry in the location list.

<li>
The action is executed at the specific line and column locations stored in the location list.

</ul>
<li>
Use Case:

<ul>
<li>
Use <code>:ldo</code> when you want to apply edits to specific matches or issues reported in a location list.

</ul>
<li>
Example: Let's say a linting tool populates the location list with unused variable warnings in the current file:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:lopen
:ldo s/unused_variable/cleaned_variable/g | update
</pre>

<p>
This substitutes all instances of <code>unused_variable</code> with <code>cleaned_variable</code> across all locations in the location list and saves the file.
</p>
 
<div id=":cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:ldo and lfdo-:lfdo - Acts on Files Referenced in the Location List"><h4 id=":lfdo - Acts on Files Referenced in the Location List" class="header"><a href="#:cdo &amp; and :cfdo AND :ldo &amp; :lfdo-:ldo and lfdo-:lfdo - Acts on Files Referenced in the Location List">:lfdo - Acts on Files Referenced in the Location List</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
What It Does:

<ul>
<li>
Similar to <code>:cfdo</code>, the <code>:lfdo</code> command applies the given action to each file referenced in the location list. It works on the entire file, not just the specific matches in the list.

</ul>
<li>
Use Case:

<ul>
<li>
Use <code>:lfdo</code> for file-wide operations, such as formatting, applying bulk edits, or saving changes, for all files referenced in the location list.

</ul>
<li>
Example: If the location list includes matches from multiple files, you could format all of them:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:lfdo normal gg=G | update
</pre>

<p>
This reformats each file from the location list and saves the changes.

<p>
The difference between <code>:ldo</code> and <code>:lfdo</code> mirrors the difference between <code>:cdo</code> and <code>:cfdo</code>, but the scope is narrower since location lists are tied to a specific window. While <code>:ldo</code> focuses on individual matches in the list, <code>:lfdo</code> tackles every file associated with the list, even if it's not currently displayed.

These entries are typically generated as a result of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Running a compiler (:make) to capture errors or warnings.

<li>
Performing a search across multiple files.

<li>
Using custom scripts or commands to populate the list.

</ul>
<p>
You can navigate these locations using commands like <code>:cnext</code>, <code>:cprev</code>, or display the list using <code>:copen</code>.

<ul>
<li>
Running a Compiler

<ul>
<li>
The quickfix list is often generated automatically when you run commands like <code>:make</code>:

</ul>
</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:make
</pre>

<p>
This compiles the code and captures errors into the quickfix list.
</p>

<div id="Quickfix or Quick Lists-Grep Results"><h3 id="Grep Results" class="header"><a href="#Quickfix or Quick Lists-Grep Results">Grep Results</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
You can populate the quickfix list with search results using <code>:grep</code> or <code>:vimgrep</code>:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:grep pattern **/*.c
</pre>

<p>
This searches for pattern in all .c files and populates the quickfix list with matches.
</p>

<p>
When you use the :grep command with <code>**/*.c</code>, it searches for files matching the given pattern (<code>**/*.c</code>) in the present working directory (<code>pwd</code>) and its subdirectories. Here’s how it works:
</p>

<div id="Quickfix or Quick Lists-Grep Results-How :grep Functions"><h4 id="How :grep Functions" class="header"><a href="#Quickfix or Quick Lists-Grep Results-How :grep Functions">How :grep Functions</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Pattern (<code>pattern</code>): The text you want to search for within the files.

<li>
Files (<code>**/*.c</code>): This glob pattern (<code>**/*.c</code>) instructs Vim to search all .c files in the current directory and all subdirectories.

</ul>
<div id="Quickfix or Quick Lists-Grep Results-Scope of Search"><h4 id="Scope of Search" class="header"><a href="#Quickfix or Quick Lists-Grep Results-Scope of Search">Scope of Search</a></h4></div>

<p>
The <code>**/*.c</code> uses the shell's globbing capabilities, which means:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Current Directory: The search starts in the present working directory.

<li>
Subdirectories: The ** wildcard ensures that all subdirectories are included recursively.

</ul>
<div id="Quickfix or Quick Lists-Grep Results-Testing/Customizing"><h4 id="Testing/Customizing" class="header"><a href="#Quickfix or Quick Lists-Grep Results-Testing/Customizing">Testing/Customizing</a></h4></div>

<p>
If you want to confirm the search is restricted to a specific folder or adjust its scope:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use an absolute path:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:grep pattern /path/to/directory/**/*.c
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Limit to only the current directory (non-recursive):

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:grep pattern *.c
</pre>


<div id="Quickfix or Quick Lists-Manually Adding Entries"><h3 id="Manually Adding Entries" class="header"><a href="#Quickfix or Quick Lists-Manually Adding Entries">Manually Adding Entries</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
You can create or add to a quickfix list programmatically using the setqflist() function:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:call setqflist([], 'a', {'title': 'My Quickfix List', 'lines': ['file1.c:10:Warning', 'file2.c:20:Error']})
</pre>

<p>
This allows you to define your own list of entries.

<ul>
<li>
Once you have a quickfix list, you can navigate through it using these commands:

<ul>
<li>
<code>:copen</code> - Open the quickfix window to view all entries.

<li>
<code>:cnext</code> - Jump to the next entry in the list.

<li>
<code>:cprev</code> - Jump to the previous entry in the list.

<li>
<code>:cfirst</code> / :clast - Jump to the first/last entry.

<li>
<code>:cclose</code> - Close the quickfix window.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Within the quickfix window, pressing &lt;Enter&gt; on an entry will jump to that location.

Quickfix lists are invaluable for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Error fixing after running compilers or tests.

<li>
Searching and editing across multiple files.

<li>
Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., formatting code, applying replacements).

<p>
A location list is a set of file locations tied to a specific window in Vim. Each window can have its own independent location list, containing entries such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Search results within the window's file.

<li>
Diagnostics (e.g., linting errors) related to the file.

<li>
Custom-defined lists.

</ul>
<p>
Location lists allow precise navigation and actions within a single file or window.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You can populate a location list by searching for a pattern:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:lgrep pattern %
</pre>

<p>
This searches for pattern within the current file and stores the matches in the location list.

<ul>
<li>
To search multiple files and store the results in a location list for the current window:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:lvimgrep /pattern/ **/*.c
</pre>

<p>
This searches for pattern across all .c files and creates a location list for the current window.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You can manually add entries to a location list using the <code>setloclist()</code> function:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:call setloclist(0, [{'filename': 'file1.c', 'lnum': 10, 'col': 5, 'text': 'Error here'}], 'a')
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Here:

<ul>
<li>
0 refers to the current window.

<li>
The list is appended ('a') to the existing location list.

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Once you’ve populated a location list, you can navigate its entries using these commands:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>:lopen</code> - Open the location list window for the current window.

<li>
<code>:lnext</code> - Move to the next entry in the location list.

<li>
<code>:lprev</code> - Move to the previous entry.

<li>
<code>:lfirst</code> / <code>:llast</code> - Jump to the first/last entry in the location list.

<li>
<code>:lclose</code> - Close the location list window.

</ul>
<p>
Like with the quickfix list, pressing &lt;Enter&gt; on an entry in the location list window will jump to the location.

Clear the Location List

<ul>
<li>
You can reset the location list for the current window:

</ul>
</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:call setloclist(0, [])
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Filter or Modify the List

<li>
You can manipulate location lists programmatically using <code>getloclist()</code> and <code>setloclist()</code>:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:call setloclist(0, filter(getloclist(0), {idx, val -&gt; val.valid == 1}))
</pre>

<p>
This filters the current location list to only include valid entries.

Similar to :cdo for quickfix lists, you can use :ldo for location lists:
</p>
  
<pre vim>
:ldo s/foo/bar/g | update
</pre>

<p>
This replaces foo with bar for all entries in the location list.

<p>
Use location lists for localized tasks:

<ul>
<li>
When focusing on a single file or window.

<li>
When running diagnostics or linting tools for the current file.

<li>
When handling search results within the file.

<p>
The workflow below, reads in all files ending with '.srt' into Vim as <code>args</code>. A batch command (:argo) says to delete all lines 1 thru 2, then save the each arg/file.
</p>

<p>
<em>"update" writes the arg/buffer <span id="argdo-IF"></span><strong id="IF">IF</strong> the file has been altered.</em>
</p>
<pre>

:argdo 1,2d | update

<div id="argdo-Silent"><h2 id="Silent" class="header"><a href="#argdo-Silent">Silent</a></h2></div>

<p>
If we run a command in argdo that would evoke an error, Vim will raise an error. There area  couple of ways of suppressing this issue.
</p>

<p>
Example - if this substitute command doesn't find a match in one of the files in the 'arg' list, it will fail:
</p>
<pre>
:argdo %s/\a/*/g
</pre>

<p>
We can add an 'e' at the end to fix (but this still offers a report):
</p>
<pre>
:argdo %s/\a/*/ge
</pre>

<p>
A workaround to avoid the report is to use the :silent prefix:
</p>
<pre>
:silent argdo %s/\a/*/ge
</pre>

<p>
However, to not have any error or report, use the :silent! prefix:
</p>
<pre>
:silent! argdo %s/\a/*/g
</pre>

<p>
On the command line, you can paste the contents of a register by pressing <code>&lt;cntl&gt; r</code><code>{register}</code>.
</p>

<p>
In this context, the <code>quote:</code> register comes in handy: it contains the last executed Ex command. For example, if we start out by running a simple substitute command:
</p>

<pre>
:%s/\a/*/g
</pre>

<p>
To prefix this with argdo, simply type <code>:argdo</code>, then a space, then <code>&lt;cntl&gt; r :</code> which will produce:
</p>

<pre>
:argdo %s/\a/*/g
</pre>

<p>
After executing this command, the <code>:</code> register will contain <code>argdo %s/\a/*/g</code>. We could prefix this with silent by typing <code>:silent &lt;space&gt; &lt;cntl&gt; r:</code> to produce:
</p>

<pre>
`:silent argdo %s/\a/*/g`
</pre>

<div id="argdo-:argdo Vs :bufdo"><h2 id=":argdo Vs :bufdo" class="header"><a href="#argdo-:argdo Vs :bufdo">:argdo Vs :bufdo</a></h2></div>

<p>
Just as we can use <code>:argdo</code> to execute a command on each of the files in the arglist, we can use <code>:bufdo</code> to execute a command on each of the files in the buffer list.
</p>

<p>
In some circumstances, the buffer list and arglist may refer to the same set of files. In this case, it would make no difference whether you used <code>:bufdo</code> or <code>:argdo</code>.
</p>

<p>
It’s easy to add files to the buffer list (perhaps unintentionally), so if you use <code>:bufdo</code> there’s always a risk that it might end up touching a file that you didn’t mean to change. Whereas the arglist only changes when you tell it to. For that reason, it may be preferable to use <code>:argdo</code> instead of <code>:bufdo</code>.
