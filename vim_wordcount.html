Note: The wc (word count) command outputs three numbers by default when run on a file or input stream. Here's what those numbers represent:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lines: The number of lines in the input.

<li>
Words: The number of words in the input (a "word" is defined as any sequence of characters separated by whitespace).

<li>
Bytes: The total number of bytes in the input (essentially the size of the file or input in bytes).

</ul>
<p>
Using the <code>wc</code> shell utility can result in the wiping of the buffer's contents, leaving the wordcount result in the buffer:

<p>
there is a better way to run the wc command on a buffer without replacing its contents! Instead of using :%!wc, which processes the entire buffer and replaces it with the output of the command, you can use the following approaches to preserve your original content:
</p>

<div id="Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Run wc on the Buffer in a Temporary Way"><h3 id="Run wc on the Buffer in a Temporary Way" class="header"><a href="#Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Run wc on the Buffer in a Temporary Way">Run wc on the Buffer in a Temporary Way</a></h3></div>

<p>
You can use <code>:w !wc</code> to send the buffer's content to the <code>wc</code> command without modifying the buffer:
</p>
<pre vim>
:w !wc
</pre>

<p>
<a href="Explanation.html">Explanation</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>:w</code> writes the buffer's content to standard input.

<li>
<code>!wc</code> pipes it to the <code>wc</code> command, displaying the result in the terminal below the Vim window.

<li>
The buffer itself remains untouched.

</ul>
<p>
Note:
</p>

<p>
The <code>:w !wc</code> command in Vim does not write the buffer to disk permanently before running the wc shell command. Here's what happens:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Temporary Write: Vim temporarily writes the content of the current buffer to standard input (stdin) for the <code>wc</code> command. This action does not save the file to disk, nor does it modify the file itself.

<li>
Command Execution: The <code>wc</code> command runs on this temporary input and displays the output directly in the terminal. The buffer remains unchanged after the operation, and there’s no record of the content being saved anywhere unless explicitly redirected.

</ul>

<p>
If you'd like to count only a portion of the text, you can visually select the text (using <code>v</code> or <code>V</code>) and run the <code>wc</code> command on the selection with:
</p>
<pre vim>
:'&lt;,'&gt;!wc
</pre>

<p>
Explanation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>'&lt;,'&gt;</code> applies the shell command to the visually selected lines.

<li>
The result is shown, and the buffer isn't altered unless you explicitly replace the selection.

</ul>

<p>
To capture the <code>wc</code> output while keeping the buffer unchanged, you can redirect the buffer's content and append the word count to a new location. For example:
</p>
<pre vim>
:w !wc &gt; /tmp/wordcount.txt
:e /tmp/wordcount.txt
</pre>

<p>
This saves the buffer's word count to <code>/tmp/wordcount.txt</code>, and you can open it for reference without modifying the original buffer.

<p>
If you're working in Vim and just want a quick word count, you can run the <code>wc</code> command externally using <code>!</code> directly:
</p>
<pre vim>
" For saved buffers
:!wc %
" For unsaved buffers
:w !wc
</pre>

<p>
Explanation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>%</code> refers to the current file being edited.

<li>
If your buffer has unsaved changes, this will only count the saved state of the file—so save first with :w if needed.

<li>
Or use the <code>:w !wc</code> command instead for unsaved buffers.

</ul>
<div id="Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register"><h3 id="Store Output in a Named Register" class="header"><a href="#Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register">Store Output in a Named Register</a></h3></div>

<p>
You can capture the result of a shell command in a named register in Vim! This is a great way to store output for later use without directly affecting your buffer. Here’s how you can do it:
</p>

<div id="Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-Steps to Capture Shell Command Output in a Register"><h4 id="Steps to Capture Shell Command Output in a Register" class="header"><a href="#Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-Steps to Capture Shell Command Output in a Register">Steps to Capture Shell Command Output in a Register</a></h4></div>

<p>
Run the Shell Command Use the <code>:let</code> command to run a shell command and store its output in a named register. For example, to capture the result of the <code>wc</code> command into register <code>a</code>:
</p>
  
<div id="Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-On a saved buffer:"><h4 id="On a saved buffer:" class="header"><a href="#Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-On a saved buffer:">On a saved buffer:</a></h4></div>
<pre vim>
:let @a = system('wc ' . expand('%'))
</pre>

<p>
Explanation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>:let @a</code>: Assigns the value to register <code>a</code>.

<li>
<code>system('command')</code>: Executes the shell command (<code>wc ' . expand('%'))</code> in this case) and returns its output as a string.

<li>
Note the space in the 'wc '. This is to have space between the 'wc' command and the arg when expanded.

<li>
<code>expand('%')</code>: Refers to the current file and converts <code>%</code> into the full file path of the currently edited file. (The dot concatenates.)

</ul>
<p>
The output of the wc command will now be saved in the a register.
</p>

<div id="Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-On an unsaved buffer:"><h4 id="On an unsaved buffer:" class="header"><a href="#Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-On an unsaved buffer:">On an unsaved buffer:</a></h4></div>

<p>
Either save the buffer first and use the strategy above, or:
</p>

<pre vim>
:let @a = system('wc', getline(1, '$'))
</pre>

<p>
Here, <code>getline(1, '$')</code> retrieves all lines in the current buffer, and <code>wc</code> processes them without needing the file to exist.
</p>

<div id="Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-Access the Stored Output"><h4 id="Access the Stored Output" class="header"><a href="#Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-Access the Stored Output">Access the Stored Output</a></h4></div>

<p>
To paste the contents of the register into your buffer, use:
</p>
  
<pre vim>
"ap
</pre>

<p>
This pastes the content of register a at the current cursor position.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
To inspect the register’s content without pasting, use:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:echo @a
</pre>

<div id="Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-Examples of Usage"><h4 id="Examples of Usage" class="header"><a href="#Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Store Output in a Named Register-Examples of Usage">Examples of Usage</a></h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Count Words and Append Output If you want to count the words in your file and append the result to the end of the buffer:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:let @a = system('wc'. expand('%'))
:$put a
</pre>
<p>
<code>:$put a</code>: Adds the content of register a after the last line.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Store Date and Time Capture the current date and time from the shell into a register:

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:let @d = system('date')
:echo @d
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
Capture Errors Run a shell command and store the errors (like searching logs for "ERROR"):

</ul>
  
<pre vim>
:let @e = system('grep ERROR logfile.log')
</pre>

<div id="Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Tips"><h3 id="Tips" class="header"><a href="#Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Tips">Tips</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
Multiline Output: If the shell command returns multiple lines, each line will be preserved in the register.

<li>
Customization: Use registers (@a, @b, etc.) as temporary storage for different outputs.

<li>
Combine with Vim Commands: You can easily combine this with mappings or macros to streamline your workflow.

</ul>
<div id="Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Bonus Tip: Use Vim's Built-In Word Count"><h3 id="Bonus Tip: Use Vim's Built-In Word Count" class="header"><a href="#Alternative using command line tools-Leaving the Buffer Untouched-Bonus Tip: Use Vim's Built-In Word Count">Bonus Tip: Use Vim's Built-In Word Count</a></h3></div>

<p>
If you simply want to check the word count without leaving Vim, you can use its built-in word count feature:
Run:
</p>
<pre vim>
g Ctrl-g
</pre>

<p>
This displays statistics at the bottom of the window, including the total words in your buffer.
These approaches allow you to count words (or other statistics) while leaving your buffer untouched.
