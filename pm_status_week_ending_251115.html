TC note query
</p>
<pre>
Good morning, Dale!
I have a query on the following TC note (from the TC email). Do you know what needs changing exactly?
4600_0350_comp_15
"For continuity from TC review: horizontal gradient between warm and cool needs to be softer on central FX."
(I saw a creative comment on ShotGrid about it looking like water, but I'm ignoring that until further notice.)
</pre>


<p>
Dale Drummond
</p>
<pre>
Don't do anything on that.  It's a continuity note, and it may be addressed in the future by you or someone else.
Thanks.
</pre>

<pre>
yeah, it probably got emailed to you, so it's confusing.  Continuity notes coming out of TC review is a new thing.

Hi, Rob!  So, we have 3400/120 and 3400/40 (your next shot) on the targets list for the week.  These are both pretty big shots.  Not knowing where you are with 120, I don't know how reasonable that is as a goal.  Let me know what you think. (edited) 

Thanks!

3400/40 is a new one right? I don't think I saw that on my plate yet.
I can take a look and see how they go.

Helped set expression for painterly_pmnt effects on 'twos':
</p>

<pre>
Setting to Output On Twos
You've got a choice for setting painterly_pmnt for working on 2s. One of these should work for you!

Either set an expression on the Noise Seed field on the painterly_pmnt properties panel, or drop a FrameHold node after the painterly_pmnt node (presuming the painterly_pmnt is currently animated by the expression “frame”.)

Expression
To set the expression, apply the following in the Noise seed field:

floor(((frame)  / 2) ) * 2

…and if that seems out of sync:

floor(((frame - 1)  / 2) ) * 2 + 1

FrameHold

Set the properties of frame hold to:

first frame -&gt; 1001
increment -&gt; 2

...or if it's out of sync (one frame off for synch):

first frame -&gt; 1000
increment -&gt; 2

Jerry Huynh send Guillem Ramisa do Sota's alterations to my C++ script in the FillCells Blinkscript. I was sad to see it was an old version that had been updated/improved. I tried to merge with my latest (which I know had efficencies built in). I just saved it to the repo and planned to install.

Hey, Rob!  I hope you're feeling better.  Whenever you're ok, here's a few notes.  First key, could you bring some more orange auroras down lower in the sky?
I think these auroras need to be more orange and less white.

These rims are a bit bright and pink.

sorry, flameshot has stopped working for me.

It's the pink rims on sokka's shaved head area around 1180.kj:

* Lowered Aurora position (to see more at horizon and generally)
* Reduced intensity and saturated Aurora (more orange than burning white)
* Reduced shaved-head rims on Sokka
* Fixed frame edge artifacts from blurs
* Patched inter-character mattes (Toph &amp; Sokko)

Got the open hands closer to the key (cooler and darker)
Boosted red of Sokka's tongue.

Lightning:
Moved lightning behind aurora
Removed retime (now, it's plain 1:1 frames from the fx sequence)
Now that I've got a handle on it, it's in good shape to adjust if it needs to be repositioned/scaled/adjusted.
